<h2 class="space-above2">PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="indent">In the present volume I have grouped a series of ethnological
studies of the Indians of Eastern Pennsylvania, New
Jersey and Maryland, around what is asserted to be one of
the most curious records of ancient American history.</p>

<p class="indent">For a long time this record&mdash;the
<span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>, or Red
Score&mdash;was supposed to have been lost. Having obtained
the original text complete about a year ago, I printed a few
copies and sent them to several educated native Delawares
with a request for aid in its translation and opinions on its
authenticity. The results will be found in the following pages.</p>

<p class="indent">The interest in the subject thus excited prompted
me to a general review of our knowledge of the Lenape or Delawares,
their history and traditions, their language and customs.
This disclosed the existence of a number of MSS. not
mentioned in bibliographies, some in the first rank of importance,
especially in the field of linguistics. Of these I
have made free use.</p>

<p class="indent">In the course of these studies I have received
suggestions and assistance from a number of obliging friends, among
whom I would mention the native Delawares, the Rev. Albert
Anthony, and the Rev. John Kilbuck; Mr. Horatio Hale
and the Right Rev. E. de Schweinitz; Dr. J. Hammond
Trambull, Prof. A. M. Elliott and Gen. John Mason Brown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Not without hesitation do I send forth this volume
to the learned world. Regarded as an authentic memorial, the
original text of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>
will require a more accurate
rendering than I have been able to give it; while the
possibility that a more searching criticism will demonstrate
it to have been a fabrication may condemn as labor lost the
pains that I have bestowed upon it. Yet even in the latter
case my work will not have been in vain. There is, I trust,
sufficient in the volume to justify its appearance, apart from
the Red Score; and the latter, by means of this complete
presentation, can now be assigned its true position in American
archaeology, whatever that may be.

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Algonkin Stock</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">About the period 1500-1600, those related tribes
whom we now know by the name of Algonkins were at the height of
their prosperity. They occupied the Atlantic coast from the
Savannah river on the south to the strait of Belle Isle on the
north. The whole of Newfoundland was in their possession;
in Labrador they were neighbors to the Eskimos; their northernmost
branch, the Crees, dwelt along the southern shores
of Hudson Bay, and followed the streams which flow into it
from the west, until they met the Chipeways, closely akin
to themselves, who roamed over the water shed of Lake Superior.
The Blackfeet carried a remote dialect of their tongue
quite to the Rocky Mountains; while the fertile prairies of
Illinois and Indiana were the homes of the Miamis. The
area of Ohio and Kentucky was very thinly peopled by a few
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
of their roving bands; but east of the Alleghanies, in the
valleys of the Delaware, the Potomac and the Hudson, over
the barren hills of New England and Nova Scotia, and
throughout the swamps and forests of Virginia and the Carolinas,
their osier cabins and palisadoed strongholds, their
maize fields and workshops of stone implements, were numerously located.</p>

<p class="indent">It is needless for my purpose to enumerate the
many small tribes which made up this great group. The more prominent
were the Micmacs of Nova Scotia, the Abnakis of Maine, the
Pequots and Narragansets, in New England, the Mohegans
of the Hudson, the Lenape on the Delaware, the Nanticokes
around Chesapeake Bay, the Pascataway on the Potomac,
and the Powhatans and Shawnees further south; while
between the Great Lakes and the Ohio river were the
Ottawas, the Illinois, the Pottawatomies, the Kikapoos,
Piankishaws, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The dialects of all these were related, and evidently
at some distant day had been derived from the same primitive
tongue. Which of them had preserved the ancient forms
most closely, it may be premature to decide positively, but
the tendency of modern studies has been to assign that place
to the Cree&mdash;the northernmost of all.</p>

<p class="indent">We cannot erect a genealogical tree of these
dialects. It is not probable that they branched off, one after
another, from a common stock. The ancient tribes each took their
several ways from a common centre, and formed nuclei for
subsequent development. We may, however, group them in
such a manner as roughly to indicate their relationship. This
I do on the following page:&mdash;

<p class="indent">Granting, as we must, some common geographical
centre for these many dialects, the question where this was located
becomes an interesting one.</p>

<p class="indent">More than one attempt to answer it has been
made. Mr. Lewis H. Morgan thought there was evidence to show that
the valley of the Columbia river, Oregon, "was the initial
point from which the Algonkin stock emigrated to the great
lake region and thence to the Atlantic coast."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
This is in direct conflict with the evidence of language, as the
Blackfoot or Satsika is the most corrupt and altered of the Algonkin
dialects. Basing his argument on this evidence, Mr. Horatio
Hale reaches a conclusion precisely the reverse of that of
Morgan. "The course of migration of the Indian tribes,"
writes Mr. Hale, "has been from the Atlantic coast westward
and southward. The traditions of the Algonkins seem to
point to Hudson's Bay and the coast of Labrador."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
This latter view is certainly that which accords best with the
testimony of language and of history.</p>

<p class="indent">We know that both Chipeways and Crees have
been steadily pressing westward since their country was first
explored, driving before them the Blackfeet and Dakotas.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Cree language is built up on a few simple,
unchangeable radicals and elementary words, denoting being, relation,
energy, etc.; it has extreme regularity of construction, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
single negative, is almost wholly verbal and markedly incorporative,
has its grammatical elements better defined than its
neighbors, and a more consistent phonetic system.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
For these and similar reasons we are justified in considering it the
nearest representative we possess of the pristine Algonkin
tongue, and unless strong grounds to the contrary are
advanced, it is proper to assume that the purest dialect is
found nearest the primeval home of the stock.</p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>The Iroquois Stock</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">Surrounded on all sides by the Algonkins were the
<i>Iroquois</i>, once called the Five or Six Nations. When first
discovered they were on the St. Lawrence, near Montreal, and in
the Lake Region of Central New York. Various other, tribes,
not in their confederacy, and generally at war with them,
spoke dialects of the same language. Such were the Hurons
or Wyandots, between the Georgian Bay and Lake Erie, the
Neutral Nation on the Niagara river, the Eries on the
southern shore of the lake of that name, the Nottoways in
Virginia, and the Tuscaroras in North Carolina. The
Cherokees, found by the whites in East Tennessee, but
whose national legend, carefully preserved for generations,
located them originally on the head waters of the Ohio, were
a remote offshoot of this same stem.</p>

<h4><i>The Susquehannocks</i>.</h4>

<p class="indent">The valley of the Susquehanna river was occupied by a
tribe of Iroquois lineage and language, known as the <i>Susquehannocks,
Conestogas</i> and <i>Andastes</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
 The last name is Iroquois,
from <i>andasta</i>, a cabin pole. By some, "Susquehannock"
has also been explained as an Iroquois word, but its
form is certainly Algonkin. The terminal <i>k</i> is the place-sign,
<i>hanna</i> denotes a flowing stream, while the adjectival
prefix has been identified by Heckewelder with <i>schachage</i>,
straight, from the direct course of the river near its mouth,
and by Mr. Guss with <i>woski</i>, new, which, he thinks, referred
to fresh or spring water.</p>

<p class="indent">Of these the former will appear the preferable, if
we allow for the softening of the gutturals, which was a phonetic
trait of the Unami dialect of the Lenape.</p>

<p class="indent">The Susquehannocks were always at deadly feud
with the Iroquois, and between wars, the smallpox and the whites,
they were finally exterminated. The particulars of their
short and sad history have been presented with his characteristic
thoroughness by Dr. John G. Shea,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> and later by Prof. N. L. Guss.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
They were usually called by the Delawares <i>Mengwe</i>, which was
the term they applied to all the Iroquois-speaking tribes.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The English corrupted it to Minqua and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
Mingo, and as the eastern trail of the Susquehannocks lay
up the Conestoga Creek, and down the Christina, both
those streams were called "Mingo Creek" by the early
settlers.</p>

<p class="indent">It is important for the ethnology of Pennsylvania,
to understand that at the time of the first settlement the whole of
the Susquehanna Valley, from the Chesapeake to the New
York lakes, was owned and controlled by Iroquois-speaking
tribes. A different and erroneous opinion was expressed
by Heckewelder, and has been generally received. He
speaks of the Lenape Minsi as occupying the head waters
of the Susquehanna. This was not so in the historic period.</p>

<p class="indent">The claims of the Susquehannocks extended down
the Chesapeake Bay on the east shore, as far as the Choptank
River, and on the west shore as far as the Patuxent. In
1654 they ceded to the government of Maryland their
southern territory to these boundaries.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
The first English explorers met them on the Potomac, about the Falls,
and the Pascatoways were deserting their villages and fleeing before
them, when, in 1634, Calvert founded his colony at St. Mary's.</p>

<p class="indent">Their subjection to the Five Nations took place about
1680, and it was through the rights obtained by this conquest that,
at the treaty of Lancaster, 1744, Canassatego, the Onondaga
speaker for the Nation, claimed pay from the government of
Maryland for the lands on the Potomac, or, as that river was
called in his tongue, the <i>Cohongorontas</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<h4><i>The Hurons.</i></h4>

<p class="indent">The Hurons, Wyandots, or Wendats, were another
Iroquois people, who seem, at some remote epoch, to have come into
contact with the Lenape. The latter called them <i>Delamattenos</i><a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
and claimed to have driven them out of a portion of
their possessions. A Chipeway tradition also states that the
Hurons were driven north from the lake shores by Algonkin
tribes.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> We know, from the early accounts of the Jesuits,
that there was commercial intercourse between them and the
tribes south of the lakes, the materials of trade being principally
fish and corn.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> The Jesuit <i>Relations</i> of 1648 contain
quite a full account of a Huron convert who, in that year,
visited the Lenape on the Delaware River, and had an interview
with the Swedish Governor, whom he took to task for
neglecting the morals of his men.</p>

<h4><i>The Cherokees.</i></h4>

<p class="indent">The Cherokees were called by the Delawares <i>Kittuwa</i>
(<i>Kuttoowauw</i>, in the spelling of the native Aupaumut).
This word I suppose to be derived from the prefix, <i>kit</i>, great,
and the root <i>tawa</i> (Cree, <i>yette</i>, <i>tawa</i>), to open,
whence tawatawik, an open, <i>i.e.</i>, uninhabited place,
a wilderness (Zeisberger).</p>

<p class="indent">The designation is geographical. According to the
tradition of the Cherokees, they once lived (probably about the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
fourteenth century) in the Ohio Valley, and claimed to have
been the constructors of the Grave Creek and other earthworks
there.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
Some support is given to this claim by the
recent linguistic investigations of Mr. Horatio Hale,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
and the archaeological researches of Prof. Cyrus Thomas.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
They were driven southward by their warlike neighbors, locating
their council fire first near Monticello, Va., and the main
body reaching East Tennessee about the close of the fifteenth
century. As late as 1730 some of them continued to
live east of the Alleghanies, while, on the other hand, it is
evident, from the proper names preserved by the chroniclers
of De Soto's expedition (1542), that at that period others
held the mountains of Northern Georgia. To the Delawares
they remained <i>kit-tawa-wi</i>, inhabitants of the great wilderness
of Southern Ohio and Kentucky.</p>

<p class="indent">Delaware traditions distinctly recalled the period
when portions of the Cherokees were on the Ohio, and recounted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
long wars with them.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
When the Lenape assumed the office
of peacemaker, this feud ceased, and was not renewed until
the general turmoil of the French-Indian wars, 1750-60. After
this closed, in 1768, the Cherokees sought and effected a renewal
of their peaceful relations with the Delawares, and in
1779 they even sent a deputation of "condolence" to their
"grandfather," the Lenape, on the death of the head chief,
White Eyes.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class="f120"><b><span class="smcap">The Wapanachki or Eastern Algonkin Confederacy</span></b>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">The Confederated Tribes&mdash;The Mohegans&mdash;The
Nanticokes&mdash;The Conoys&mdash;The Shawnees&mdash;The Saponies&mdash;The Assiwikalees</p>

<h3><i>The Confederated Tribes.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">All the Algonkin nations who dwelt north of the
Potomac, on the east shore of Chesapeake Bay, and in the basins of
the Delaware and Hudson rivers, claimed near kinship and an identical
origin, and were at times united into a loose, defensive confederacy.</p>

<p class="indent">By the western and southern tribes they were collectively
known as <i>Wapanachkik</i>&mdash;"those of the eastern region"&mdash;
which in the form <i>Abnaki</i> is now confined to the remnant of
a tribe in Maine. The Delawares in the far West retain traditionally
the ancient confederate name, and still speak of
themselves as "Eastlanders"&mdash;<i>O-puh-narke</i>. (Morgan.)</p>

<p class="indent">The members of the confederacy were the Mohegans
(Mahicanni) of the Hudson, who occupied the valley of that
river to the falls above the site of Albany, the various New
Jersey tribes, the Delawares proper on the Delaware river and
its branches, including the Minsi or Monseys, among the
mountains, the Nanticokes, between Chesapeake Bay and the
Atlantic, and the small tribe called Canai, Kanawhas or Ganawese,
whose towns were on tributaries of the Potomac and Patuxent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">That all these were united in some sort of an alliance, with
the Delawares at its head, is not only proved by the traditions
of this tribe itself, but by the distinct assertion of the Mohegans
and others, and by events within historical times, as the
reunion of the Nanticokes, New Jersey and Eastern Indians
with the Delawares as with the parent stem.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Mohegans.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The Mohegans, <i>Mo-hé-kun-ne-uk</i>, dwelt on the
tide-waters of the Hudson, and from this their name was derived. Dr.
Trumbull, indeed, following Schoolcraft, thinks that they
"took their tribal name from <i>maingan</i>, a wolf, and
<i>Moheganick</i> = Chip. <i>maniganikan</i>, 'country of wolves.'"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a>
They, themselves, however, translate it, "seaside people," or more
fully, "people of the great waters which are constantly ebbing
or flowing."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
The compound is <i>machaak</i>, great, <i>hickan</i>,
tide ("ebbing tide," Zeis; "tide of flood," Campanius) and <i>ik</i>,
animate plural termination.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Mohegans on the Hudson are said to have been
divided into three phratries, the Bear, the Wolf and the
Turtle, of whom the Bear had the primacy.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
Mr. Morgan, however, who examined, in 1860, the representatives of the
nation in Kansas,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
discovered that they had precisely the
same phratries as the Delawares, that is the Wolf, the Turtle,
and the Turkey, each subdivided into three or four gentes.
He justly observes that this "proves their immediate connection
with the Delawares and Munsees by descent," and thus
renders their myths and traditions of the more import in the
present study.</p>

<p class="indent">Linguistically, the Mohegans were more closely
allied to the tribes of New England than to those of the Delaware
Valley. Evidently, most of the tribes of Massachusetts and
Connecticut were comparatively recent offshoots of the parent
stem on the Hudson, supposing the course of migration had
been eastward.</p>

<p class="indent">In some of his unpublished notes Mr. Heckewelder
identifies the <i>Wampanos</i>, who lived in Connecticut, along the
shore of Long Island Sound, and whose council fire was
where New Haven now stands, as Mohegans, while the
<i>Wapings</i> or <i>Opings</i> of the Northern Jersey shore were a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
mixed clan derived from intermarriages between Mohegans and
Monseys.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Nanticokes</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Nanticokes occupied the territory between
Chesapeake Bay and the ocean, except its southern extremity, which
appears to have been under the control of the Powhatan tribe
of Virginia.</p>

<p class="indent">The derivation of Nanticoke is from the Delaware <i>Unéchtgo</i>,
"tide-water people," and is merely another form of <i>Unalachtgo</i>,
the name of one of the Lenape sub-tribes. In both
cases it is a mere geographical term, and not a national eponym.</p>

<p class="indent">In the records of the treaty at Fort Johnston, 1757,
the Nanticokes are also named <i>Tiawco</i>. This is their Mohegan
name, <i>Otayãchgo</i>, which means "bridge people," or bridge
makers, the reference being to the skill with which the Nanticokes
could fasten floating logs together to construct a bridge across a
stream. In the Delaware dialect this was <i>Tawachguáno</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
from <i>taiachquoan</i>, a bridge. The latter enables us to
identify the Tockwhoghs, whom Captain John Smith met on
the Chesapeake, in 1608, with the Nanticokes. The <i>Kuscarawocks</i>,
whom he also visited, have been conclusively
shown by Mr. Bozman<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
to have been also Nanticokes.</p>

<p class="indent">By ancient traditions, they looked up to the Lenape as their
"grandfather," and considered the Mohegans their "brethren."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
That is, they were, as occasion required, attached to the same confederacy.</p>

<p class="indent">In manners and customs they differed little from
their northern relatives. The only peculiarity in this respect which
is noted of them was the extravagant consideration they bestowed
on the bones of the dead. The corpse was buried for
some months, then exhumed and the bones carefully cleaned
and placed in an ossuary called <i>man-to-kump</i> (= <i>manito</i>,
with the locative termination, place of the mystery or spirit).</p>

<p class="indent">When they removed from one place to another these
bones were carried with them. Even those who migrated to northern
Pennsylvania, about the middle of the last century, piously
brought along these venerable relics, and finally interred them
near the present site of Towanda, whence its name, <i>Tawundeunk</i>,
"where we bury our dead."<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Their dialect varied considerably from the Delaware;
of which it is clearly a deteriorated form. It is characterized by
abbreviated words and strongly expirated accents, as <i>tah!
quah! quak! su</i>, short; <i>quah! nah! qut</i>, long.</p>

<p class="indent">Our knowledge of it is limited to a few vocabularies.
The earliest was taken down by Captain John Smith, during his
exploration of the Chesapeake. The most valuable is one
obtained by Mr. William Vans Murray, in 1792, from the
remnant in Maryland. It is in the library of the American
Philosophical Society, and has never been correctly or
completely printed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Nanticokes broke up early. Between the
steady encroachments of the whites and the attacks of the Iroquois
they found themselves between the upper and the nether millstones.</p>

<p class="indent">According to their own statement to Governor Evans,
at a conference in 1707, they had at that time been tributary to
the latter for twenty-seven years, <i>i.e.</i>, since 1680. Their
last head chief, or "crowned king," Winicaco, died about 1720.
A few years after this occurrence bands of them began to remove
to Pennsylvania, and at the middle of the century
were living at the mouth of the Juniata, under the immediate
control of the Iroquois. Thence they removed to Wyoming,
and in 1753, "in a fleet of twenty-five canoes," to the Iroquois
lands in western New York. Others of their nation
were brought there by the Iroquois in 1767; but by the
close of the century only five families survived in that
region.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">A small band called the <i>Wiwash</i> remained on
Goose creek, Dorchester county, Maryland, to the same date.</p>

<h3><i>The Conoys.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The fourth member of the Wapanachki was that nation
variously called in the old records <i>Conoys</i>, <i>Ganawese</i> or
<i>Canaways</i>, the proper form of which Mr. Heckewelder states
to be <i>Canai</i>.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Considerable obscurity has rested on the early
location and affiliation of this people. Mr. Heckewelder vaguely
places them "at a distance on the Potomac," and supposes them to
have been the Kanawhas of West Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
This is a loose guess. They were, in fact, none other than the
Piscataways of Southern Maryland, who occupied the area between
Chesapeake Bay and the lower Potomac, about St. Mary's, and
along the Piscataway creek and Patuxent river.</p>

<p class="indent">Proof of this is furnished by the speech of their
venerable head chief, "Old Sack," at a conference in Philadelphia in
1743.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
His words were: "Our forefathers came from Piscatua
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to an island in Potowmeck; and from thence down to
Philadelphia, in old Proprietor Penn's time, to show their
friendship to the Proprietor. After their return they brought
down all their brothers from Potowmeck to Conejoholo, on
the east side Sasquehannah, and built a town there."</p>

<p class="indent">This interesting identification shows that they
were the people whom Captain John Smith found (1608) in numerous
villages along the Patuxent and the left bank of the lower
Potomac. The local names show them to have been of
Algonkin stock and akin to the Nanticokes.</p>

<p class="indent">Conoy, Ganawese, Kanawha, are all various spellings
of a derivative from an Algonkin root, meaning "it is long"
(Del. <i>guneu</i>, long, Cree <i>kinowaw</i>, it is long,)
and is found applied to various streams in Algonkin territory.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Piscataway, or Pascatoway, as it is spelled in the
early narratives, also recurs as a local name in various parts of the
Northern States. It is from, the root <i>pashk</i>, which means to
separate, to divide. Many derivatives from it are in use in
the Delaware tongue. In the Cree we have the impersonal
form, <i>pakestikweyaw</i>, or the active animate <i>pasketiwa</i>,
in the sense of "the division or branch of a river."<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
The site of Kittamaquindi (<i>kittamaque-ink</i>, Great Beaver Place,)
the so-called "metropolis of Pascatoe,"<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
was where Tinker's creek and Piscataway creek branch off from their
common estuary, about fifteen miles south of Washington city.</p>

<p class="indent">The "emperor" Chitomachen, Strong Bear (<i>chitani</i>,
strong, <i>macha</i>, bear), who bore the title <i>Tayac</i> (Nanticoke,
<i>tallak</i>, head chief) ruled over a dominion which extended
about 130 miles from east to west.</p>

<p class="indent">The district was thinly peopled. On the upper
shores of the west side of the Chesapeake Captain John Smith and
the other early explorers found scarcely any inhabitants. In
1631 Captain Henry Fleet estimated the total number of
natives "in Potomack and places adjacent," at not over
5000 persons.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
This included both sides of the river as high
up as the Falls, and the shores of Chesapeake Bay.</p>

<p class="indent">Chitomachen, with his family, was converted to the
Catholic faith in 1640, by the exertions of the Jesuit missionary,
Father Andrew White, but died the year after. When the English
first settled at St. Mary's, the tribe was deserting its ancient
seats, through fear of the Susquehannocks, and diminished
rapidly after that date.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Father White was among them from 1634 to 1642,
and composed a grammar, dictionary and catechism of their
tongue. Of these, the catechism is yet preserved in manuscript,
in the library of the Domus Professa of the Jesuits, in
Rome. It would be a great benefit to students of Algonkin
dialects to have his linguistic works sought out and published.
How far his knowledge of the language extended is uncertain.
In a letter from one of the missionaries, dated 1642, who
speaks of White, the writer adds: "The difficulty of the
language is so great that none of us can yet converse with the
Indians without an interpreter."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p class="indent">That it was an Algonkin dialect, closely akin to
the Nanticoke, is clear from the words and proper names preserved in
the early records and locally to this day. The only word
which has created doubts has been the name of "a certain
imaginary spirit called <i>Ochre</i>."<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a>
It has been supposed that
this was the Huron <i>oki</i>. But it is pure Algonkin. It is the
Cree <i>oki-sikow</i> (<i>être du ciel</i>, <i>ange</i>, Lacombe),
the Abnaki <i>ooskoo</i> (<i>katini ooskoo</i>, Bon Esprit,
<i>matsini ooskoo</i>, Mauvais Esprit, Rasles).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It was nearly allied to that spoken in Virginia among
Powhatan's subjects, as an English boy who had lived with that
chieftain served as an interpreter between the settlers and the
Patuxent and neighboring Indians.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Conoys were removed, before 1743, from Conejoholo
to Conoy town, further up the Susquehanna, and in 1744 they
joined several other fragmentary bands at Shamokin (where
Sunbury, Pa., now stands). Later, they became merged with
the Nanticokes.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Shawnees</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The wanderings of the unstable and migratory Shawnees
have occupied the attention of several writers, but it cannot
be said that either their history or their affiliations have been
satisfactorily worked out.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Their dialect is more akin to the Mohegan than to
the Delaware, and when, in 1692, they first appeared in the area
of the Eastern Algonkin Confederacy, they came as the
friends and relatives of the former.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p class="indent">They were divided into four bands, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">1. <i>Piqua</i>, properly <i>Pikoweu</i>, "he comes from the ashes."</p>

<p class="blockquot">2. <i>Mequachake</i>, "a fat man filled," signifying completion or
perfection. This band held the privilege of the hereditary priesthood.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p class="blockquot">3. Kiscapocoke.</p>

<p class="blockquot">4. Chilicothe.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of these, that which settled in Pennsylvania was
the <i>Pikoweu</i>, who occupied and gave their name to the Pequa
valley in Lancaster county.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p class="indent">According to ancient Mohegan tradition, the New England
<i>Pequods</i> were members of this band. These moved eastwardly
from the Hudson river, and extended their conquests
over the greater part of the area of Connecticut. Dr.
Trumbull, however,<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
assigns a different meaning to their name,
and a more appropriate one&mdash;<i>Peguitóog</i>, the Destroyers.
Some countenance is given to the tradition by the
similarity of the Shawnee to the Mohegan, standing, as it
does, more closely related to it than to the Unami Delaware.</p>

<p class="indent">It has been argued that a band of the Shawnees
lived in Southern New Jersey when that territory first came to the
knowledge of the whites. On a Dutch map, drawn in 1614
or thereabouts, a tribe called <i>Saw wanew</i> is located on the left
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
bank of the Delaware river, near the Bay;<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a>
and DeLaet speaks of the <i>Sawanoos</i> as living there.</p>

<p class="indent">I am inclined to believe that, in both these cases,
the term was used by the natives around New York Bay in its simple
geographical sense of "south" or "southern," and not as a
tribal designation. It frequently appears with this original
meaning in the <span class="smcap">Waluam Olum</span>.</p>

<h3><i>The Sapoonees</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">A tribe called the Sapoonees, or Saponies, is mentioned
as living in Pennsylvania, attached to the Delawares, about the
middle of the last century.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<p class="indent">They are no doubt the Saponas who once dwelt on
a branch of the Great Pedee river in North Carolina, and who moved
north about the year 1720.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p class="indent">They were said to have joined the Tuscaroras, but the
Pennsylvania records class them with the Delawares. Others, impressed by
the similarity of <i>Sa-po-nees</i> to <i>Pa-nis</i>, have imagined they
were the Pawnees, now of the west. There is not the slightest
importance to be attached to this casual similarity of names.</p>

<p class="indent">They were called, by the Iroquois, <i>Tadirighrones</i>,
and were distinctly identified by them with the nation known to the
English as the Catawbas.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a>
For a long time the two nations carried on a bitter warfare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Assiwikales</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">This band of about fifty families, or one hundred
men (about three hundred souls), are stated to have come from
South Carolina to the Potomac late in the seventeenth century,
and in 1731 were settled partly on the Susquehanna and partly
on the upper Ohio or Alleghany. Their chief was named
Aqueioma, or Achequeloma.</p>

<p class="indent">Their name appears to be a compound of <i>assin</i>,
stone; and <i>wikwam</i>, house, and they were probably Algonkin neighbors
of the Shawnees in their southern homes, and united with
them in their northern migration.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>

<p class="f120"><b><span class="smcap">The Lenape or Delawares</span></b>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">Derivation of the Name Lenape.&mdash;The Three Sub-Tribes the

Totems&mdash;The New Jersey Tribes the Wapings, Sanhicans and

<h3><i>Derivation of Lenni Lenape</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The proper name of the Delaware Indians was and is
<i>Lenapé</i>, (a as in father, é as a in mate). Dr. J. Hammond
Trumbull<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
is quite wide of the mark both in calling this a
"misnomer," and in attributing its introduction to Mr. Heckewelder.</p>

<p class="indent">Long before that worthy missionary was born, the
name was in use in the official documents of the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania as the synonym in the native tongue for the
Delaware Indians,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
and it is still retained by their remnant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
in Kansas as the proper term to designate their collective
nation, embracing its sub-tribes.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The derivation of <i>Lenape</i> has been discussed with no
little learning, as well as the adjective <i>lenni</i>, which often precedes
it (Lenni Lenape). Mr. Heckewelder stated that <i>lenni</i> means
"original, pure," and that <i>Lenape</i> signifies "people."<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
Dr. Trumbull, in the course of a long examination of the words
for "man" in the Algonkin dialects, reaches the conclusion
that "Len-âpé" denotes "a common adult male," <i>i. e.</i>, an
Indian man; <i>lenno lenâpé</i>, an Indian of <i>our</i> tribe or
nation, and, consequently, <i>vir</i>, "a man of men."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
He derives these two words from the roots <i>len</i> (= <i>nen</i>),
a pronominal possessive, and <i>ape</i>, an inseparable generic particle,
"denoting an adult male."</p>

<p class="indent">I differ, with hesitation, from such an eminent
authority; but this explanation does not, to my mind, give the precise
meaning of the term. No doubt, both <i>lenno</i>, which in Delaware
means <i>man</i>, and <i>len</i>, in Lenape, are from the pronominal
radicle of the first person <i>né</i>, I, we, mine, our. As the
native considered his tribe the oldest, as well as the most
important of created beings, "ours" with him came to be
synonymous with what was esteemed ancient, indigenous,
primeval, as well as human, man-like, <i>par excellence</i>. "We"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
and "men" were to him the same. The initial <i>l</i> is but a
slight modification of the <i>n</i> sound, and is given by Campanius
as an <i>r</i>, "<i>rhenus</i>, homo."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lenape</i>, therefore, does not mean "a common adult male,"
but rather "a male of our kind," or "our men."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The termination <i>apé</i> is said by Heckewelder to
convey the idea of "walking or being in an erect posture." A
comparison of the various Algonkin dialects indicates that
it was originally a locative, signifying staying in a place,
abiding or sitting. Thus, in Cree, <i>apú</i>, he is there; in
Chipeway, <i>abi</i>, he is at home; in Delaware, <i>n'dappin</i>, I am
here. The transfer of this idea to the male sex is seen in
the Cree, <i>ap</i>, to sit upon, to place oneself on top, <i>apa</i>, to
cover (animate and active); Chipeway, <i>nabe</i>, the male of
quadrupeds. Baraga says that for a Chipeway woman to
call her husband <i>nin nabem</i> (lit. my coverer, comp. French,
<i>femme couverte</i>), is coarse.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Lenape Sub-Tribes.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The Lenape were divided into three sub-tribes:&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="m-left_3">1. The Minsi, Monseys, Montheys, Munsees, or Minisinks.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">2. The Unami, or Wonameys.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">3. The Unalachtigo.</span></p>

<p class="indent">No explanation of these designations will be found
in Heckewelder or the older writers. From investigations among living
Delawares, carried out at my request by Mr. Horatio Hale,
it is evident that they are wholly geographical, and refer to
the locations of these sub-tribes on the Delaware river.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Minsi</i>, properly <i>Minsiu</i>, and formerly <i>Minassiniu</i>,
means "people of the stony country," or briefly, "mountaineers."
It is a synthesis of <i>minthiu</i>, to be scattered, and <i>achsin</i>, stone,
according to the best living native authorities.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p class="indent"><i>Unami</i>, or <i>W'nãmiu</i>, means "people down
the river," from <i>naheu</i>, down-stream.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Unalachtigo</i>, properly <i>W'nalãchtko</i>, means
"people who live near the ocean," from <i>wunalawat</i>, to go towards,
and <i>t'kow</i> or <i>t'kou</i>, wave.</p>

<p class="indent">Historically, such were the positions of these
sub-tribes when they first came to the knowledge of Europeans.</p>

<p class="indent">The Minsi lived in the mountainous region at the
head waters of the Delaware, above the Forks, or junction of the
Lehigh river. One of their principal fires was on the
Minisink plains, above the Water Gap, and another on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
East Branch of the Delaware, which they called <i>Namaes Sipu</i>,
Fish River. Their hunting grounds embraced lands now in
the three colonies of Pennsylvania, New York and New
Jersey. The last mentioned extinguished their title in 1758,
by the payment of one thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="indent">That, at any time, as Heckewelder asserts, their
territory extended up the Hudson as far as tide-water, and westward
"far beyond the Susquehannah," is surely incorrect. Only
after the beginning of the eighteenth century, when they
had been long subject to the Iroquois, have we any
historic evidence that they had a settlement on the last
named river.</p>

<p class="indent">The Unamis' territory on the right bank of the
Delaware river extended from the Lehigh valley southward. It was
with them and their southern neighbors, the Unalachtigos,
that Penn dealt for the land ceded him in the Indian Deed
of 1682. The Minsis did not take part in the transaction,
and it was not until 1737 that the Colonial authorities
treated directly with the latter for the cession of their
territory.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Unalachtigo or Turkey totem had its principal
seat on the affluents of the Delaware near where Wilmington now
stands. About this point, Captain John Smith, on his map
(1609,) locates the <i>Chikahokin</i>. In later writers this name is
spelled <i>Chihohockies</i>, <i>Chiholacki</i> and <i>Chikolacki</i>,
and is stated by the historians Proud and Smith to be synonymous with
Delawares.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
The correct form is <i>Chikelaki</i>, from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
<i>chik'eno</i>, turkey, the modern form as given by Whipple,<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
and <i>aki</i> land. The <i>n</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>r</i> were
alternating letters in this dialect.</p>

<p class="indent">The population was, however, very sparse, owing
to the predatory incursions of the Susquehannocks, whose trails,
leading up the Octorara and Conestoga, and down the Christina
and Brandywine Creeks, were followed by war parties
annually, and desolated the west shores of the Bay and lower
river. When, in 1634, Captain Thomas Young explored the
river, the few natives he found on the west side told him
(through the medium of his Algonkin Virginian interpreter)
that the "Minquaos" had killed their people, burnt their
villages, and destroyed their crops, so that "the Indians had
wholly left that side of the river which was next their
enemies, and had retired themselves on the other side farre
up into the woods."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p class="indent">North of the Chikelaki, Smith's map locates the <i>Macovks</i>.
This name does not appear in later authors, but near that site
were the <i>Okahoki</i> band, who occupied the shores of Ridley
and Crum creeks and the land between them. There they
remained until 1703, when they were removed to a small
reservation of 500 acres in what is now Willistown township,
Chester county.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>The Totemic Animals.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">These three sub-tribes had each its totemic animal,
from which it claimed a mystical descent. The Minsi had the
Wolf, the Unami the Turtle, and the Unalachtigo the Turkey.
The Unamis claimed and were conceded the precedence of
the others, because their ancestor, the Turtle, was not the
common animal, so-called, but the great original tortoise
which bears the world on its back, and was the first of living
beings, as I shall explain on a later page.</p>

<p class="indent">In referring to the totemic animals the common
names were not used, but metaphorical expressions. Thus the Wolf
was referred to as <i>Ptuksit</i>, Round Foot (<i>ptuk</i>, round,
<i>sit</i>, foot, from the shape of its paws;) the turtle was
<i>Pakoango</i>, the Crawler; and the turkey was <i>Pullaeu</i>,
he does not chew,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
referring to the bird's manner of swallowing food.</p>

<p class="indent">The signs of these animals were employed in their
picture writing, painted on their houses or inscribed on rocks, to
designate the respective sub-tribes. But only in the case of
the Unamis was the whole animal represented. The Turkey
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
tribe painted only one foot of their totemic bird, and the
Minsi the extended foot of the wolf, though they sometimes
added an outline of the rest of the animal.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a></p>

<p class="indent">These three divisions of the Lenape were neither
"gentes" nor "phratries," though Mr. Morgan has endeavored to
force them into his system by stating that they were "of the
nature of phratries."<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a>
Each was divided into twelve
families bearing female names, and hence probably referring
to some unexplained matriarchal system. They were, as I
have called them, sub-tribes. In their own orations they
referred to each other as "playmates." (Heckewelder.)</p>

<h3><i>The New Jersey Lenape.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The native name of New Jersey is given as Shã'akbee
(English orthography: ã as in fate); or as the German missionaries
wrote it, <i>Sche'jachbi</i>. It is a compound of <i>bi</i>, water,
<i>aki</i>, land, and the adjective prefix <i>schey</i>, which means
something long and narrow (<i>scheyek</i>, a string of wampum;
<i>schajelinquall</i>, the edge of the eyes, the eyelids, etc.)
This would be equivalent to "long-land water," and, according to
the rules of Delaware grammar, which place the noun used in
the genitive sense before the noun which governs it, the term
would be more suitable to some body of water, Delaware bay
or the ocean, than to the main land.</p>

<p class="indent">The Lenape distinctly claimed the whole of the
present area of New Jersey. Their great chief, Tedyuscung, stated
at the Conference at Easton (1757), that their lands reached
eastward to the shore of the sea. The New Jersey tribes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
fully recognized their unity. As early as 1694, at an interview
with Governor Markham at Philadelphia, when the
famous Tamany and other Lenape chieftains were present,
Mohocksey, a chief of the Jersey Indians, said: "Though
we live on the other side of the water (<i>i.e.</i>, the Delaware
river), yet we reckon ourselves all one, because," he added,
giving a characteristically native reason, "because we drink
one water."<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The names, number and position of the Jersey
tribes have not been very clearly made out.
A pamphlet published in London, in 1648, states that there
were twenty-three Indian kinglets in its area, with about 2000
warriors in all. Of these, Master Robert Evelin, a surveyor,
who spent several years in the Province about 1635, names
nine on the left bank of the Delaware, between Cape May
and the Falls. The names are extremely corrupt, but it may
be worth while giving them.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>
<span class="m-left_3">1. Kechemeches, 500 men, five miles above Cape May.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">2. Manteses, 100 bowmen, twelve leagues above the former.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">3. Sikonesses.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">4. Asomoches, 100 men.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">5. Eriwoneck, 40 men.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">6. Ramcock, 100 men.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">7. Axion, 200 men.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">8. Calcefar, 150 men.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_3">9. Mosilian, 200 men, at the Falls.</span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Of these, the Mantes lived on Salem creek; <i>Ramcock</i>
is Rancocas creek; the <i>Eriwoneck</i> are evidently the <i>Ermomex</i>
of Van der Donck's map of 1656; <i>Axion</i> may be for Assiscunk
creek, above Burlington, from Del. <i>assiscu</i>, mud;
<i>assiscunk</i>, a muddy place. Lindstrom and Van der Donck name
the most Southern tribe in New Jersey <i>Naraticons</i>. They
were on and near Raccoon creek, which on Lindstrom's map
is <i>Narraticon Sipu</i>, the Naraticon river. Probably the English
name is simply a translation of the Del. <i>nachenum</i>, raccoon.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1675 the number of sachems in Jersey of sufficient
importance for the then Governor Andros to treat with were
four. It is noted that when he had made them the presents
customary on such occasions, "They return thanks and fall a
kintacoying, singing <i>kenon, kenon</i>."<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
This was the Delaware <i>genan</i> (<i>genama</i>, thank ye him. Zeis).</p>

<p class="indent">The total number in New Jersey a few years before this
(1671) were estimated by the authorities at "about a thousand
persons, besides women and children."<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The "<i>Wakings, Opings</i> or <i>Pomptons</i>," as they
are named in the old records, were the tribe which dwelt on the west
shore of New York harbor and southwardly, or, more
exactly, "from Roeloff Jansen's Kill to the sea."<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
They were of the Minsi totem, and were the earliest of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
Lenape who saw white men, when, in 1524, the keel of
Verrazano was the first to plough the waters of New York harbor.</p>

<p class="indent">The name Waping or Oping is derived from <i>Wapan</i>,
east, and was applied to them as the easternmost of the Lenape
nation.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Their other name, Pompton, Mr Heckewelder identifies with
<i>pihm-tom</i>, crooked-mouthed, though its applicability
is not obvious.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the middle of the eighteenth century the remains
of the Pompton Indians resided on the Raritan river. The boundaries
of their territory were defined in 1756, at the Treaty of Crosswicks.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Sanhicans</i> occupied the Delaware shore at
the Falls, near where Trenton now stands, and extended eastward along
the upper Indian path quite to New York bay. Heckewelder
says that this name, <i>Sankhicani</i>, means a gun lock, and was
applied by the Lenape to the Mohawks who were first furnished
with muskets by the Europeans. This has led some writers
to locate a band of Mohawks at the Falls.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">The Sanhicans were, however, undoubtedly Lenape.
Campanius, who quotes the name of the place in 1642, classes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
them as such. In Van der Donck's map, of 1656, they are
marked as possessing the land at the Falls and Manhattan
Bay; and De Laet gives the numerals and a number of words
from their dialect, which are all pure Delaware, as:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">Their name has lost its first syllable.
It should be <i>assanhican</i>. This means not merely and not originally
a gun-flint, but any stone implement, from <i>achsin</i>, or, in
the New Jersey dialect, <i>assun</i>, a stone, and <i>hican</i>,
an instrument. They were distinctively "the stone-implement people."</p>

<p class="indent">This is plainly with reference to their manufactures
near Trenton. The great deposit of post-glacial gravels at this
point abound with quartzite fragments suitable for working
into stone implements, and to what extent they were utilized
by the natives is shown by the enormous collection, numbering
over thirty thousand specimens, which Dr. Charles C.
Abbott, of Trenton, has made in that immediate vicinity. A
horde of over 125 beautifully chipped lance heads of quartz
and jasper, and the remains of a workshop of remarkable
magnitude, were evidences of the extensive manufacture that
once prevailed there.</p>

<p class="indent">The left bank of the Delaware, from the vicinity
of Burlington quite to and below Salem, was held by a warlike tribe
known to the settlers as the <i>Mantas</i>, or <i>Mantos</i>, or
<i>Mandes</i>, otherwise named the Frog Indians. They extended eastward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
along the main or southern Indian path, which led from the
Delaware, below the mouth of Rancocas Creek, to the
extensive Indian plantations or corn fields near Sandy Hook,
mentioned by Campanius and Lindstrom.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Henry has derived their name from
<i>mangi</i>, great,<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a>
and others have suggested <i>menatey</i>, an island; but I do not
think either of these is tenable. I have no doubt that <i>mante</i>
is simply a mis-spelling of <i>monthee</i>, which is the form given
by the East Jersey and Stockbridge Indians to the name of
the Minsi or Monsey sub-tribe of the Delawares.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
This is further indicated by the fact that toward the beginning
of the eighteenth century they incorporated themselves
wholly with the two other Lenape sub-tribes.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
We thus find that the Minsis were not confined to the North and
Northwest, as Heckewelder and others wrote, but had pressed
southward in New Jersey, quite to the shores of Delaware Bay.</p>

<p class="indent">The New Jersey Indians disappeared rapidly. As
early as 1721 an official document states that they were "but few,
and very innocent and friendly."<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>
When, in 1745, the missionary Brainerd visited their settlement at
Crosweeksung, Burlington county, he found some "who had lived with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
white people under gospel light, had learned to read, were
civil, etc."<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
Those with whom he labored at this place
subsequently removed to New Stockbridge, Mass., and united
with the Mohegans and others there.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Swedish traveler, Peter Kalm, who spent about
a year in New Jersey in 1749, observes that the disappearance of
the native population was principally due to two agencies.
Smallpox destroyed "incredible numbers", "but brandy
has killed most of the Indians."<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The dialect of the New Jersey Indians was soft and
vocalic, avoiding the gutturals of their northern relatives, and without
the frequent unpleasant forcible expirations of the Nanticoke.
A vocabulary of it, obtained for Mr. Thomas Jefferson,
in 1792, at the village of Edgpiihik, West New Jersey, is in
MS. in the library of the American Philosophical Society.</p>

<h3><i>Political Constitution</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">Each totem of the Lenape recognized a chieftain,
called sachem, <i>sakima</i>, a word found in most Algonkin dialects,
with slight variations (Chip. <i>ogima</i>, Cree, <i>okimaw</i>, Pequot,
<i>sachimma</i>), and derived from a root <i>ôki</i>, signifying above in
space, and by a transfer frequent in all languages, above in
power. Thus, in Cree,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a>
we have <i>sâkamow</i>, "il projecte, il
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
montre la tête," and in Delaware, <i>w'ochgitschi</i>, the part
above, the upper part (Zeisberger), etc.</p>

<p class="indent">It appears from Mr. Morgan's inquiries, that at
present and of later years, "the office of sachem is hereditary in
the gens, but elective among its members."<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Loskiel, however, writing on the excellent authority of Zeisberger, states
explicitly that the chief of each totem was selected and
inaugurated by those of the remaining two.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a>
By common and ancient consent, the chief selected from the Turtle
totem was head chief of the whole Lenape nation.</p>

<p class="indent">These chieftains were the "peace chiefs." They
could neither go to war themselves, nor send nor receive the war
belt&mdash;the ominous string of dark wampum, which indicated
that the tempest of strife was to be let loose. Their proper
badge was the wampum belt, with a diamond-shaped figure
in the centre, worked in white beads, which was the symbol
of the peaceful council fire, and was called by that name.</p>

<p class="indent">War was declared by the people at the instigation
of the "war captains," valorous braves of any birth or family who
had distinguished themselves by personal prowess, and especially
by good success in forays against the enemy.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Nor did the authority of the chiefs extend to any
infringement on the traditional rights of the gens, as, for instance,
that of blood revenge. The ignorance of this limitation of
the central power led to various misunderstandings at the
time, on the part of the colonial authorities, and since then,
by later historians. Thus, in 1728, "the Delaware Indians
on Brandywine" were summoned by the Governor to answer
about a murder. Their chief, Civility, answered that it was
committed by the Minisinks, "over whom they had no
authority."<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>
This did not mean but that in some matters authority
could be exerted, but not in a question relating to
a feud of blood.</p>

<h3><i>Agriculture and Food Resources</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Lenape did not depend solely on the chase for
subsistence. They were largely agricultural, and raised a variety
of edible plants. Indian corn was, as usual, the staple; but
in addition to that, they had extensive fields of squashes,
beans and sweet potatoes.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
The hardy variety of tobacco was also freely cultivated.</p>

<p class="indent">The value of Indian corn, the <i>Zea mais</i>, must
have been known to the Algonkin tribes while they still formed one
nation, as the same name is applied to it by tribes geographically
the widest apart. Thus the Micmacs of Nova Scotia
call it <i>pe-ãs'kumun-ul</i> whose theme <i>ãs'ku-mun</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
reappears in the <i>wuskannem</i> (Elliott) and the <i>scannemeneash</i>
(Roger Williams) of New England, in the Delaware <i>jesquem</i>
(Campanius), and <i>chasquem</i> (Zeis.), and even in the Piegan
Blackfoot <i>esko-tope</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The first radical <i>ask</i>, Chip. <i>ashk</i>, Del.
<i>aski</i>, means "green." The application is to the green waving plant, so
conspicuous in the fields during the summer months. The second <i>mün</i>
or <i>min</i> is a generic suffix applied to all sorts of small edible
fruits. In the Blackfoot its place is supplied by another, and in the
Unami Delaware it is abbreviated to the letter <i>m</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, in the Chipeway word for corn,
<i>mandamin</i>, Ottawa <i>mindamin</i>, Cree <i>mattamin</i>, the second
radical is retained in full, while for the first is substituted an
abbreviation of <i>manito</i>, divine ("it is divine, supernatural, or
mysterious"); if we may accept the opinion of Mr. Schoolcraft,
and I know of no more plausible etymology.</p>

<p class="indent">Tobacco was called by the Delawares <i>kscha-tey</i>,
Zeis., <i>seka-ta</i>, Camp., or in the English orthography <i>shuate</i>
(Vocab. N. J. Inds.), and <i>koshãhtahe</i> (Cummmings). I am inclined to
think that these are but dialectic variations and different
orthographies of the root <i>'ta</i> or <i>'dam</i> (<i>a</i> nasal)
found in the New England <i>wuttãm-anog</i>, Micmac <i>tùmawa</i>,
Abnaki <i>wh'dãman</i> (Rasle), Cree <i>tchistémaw</i>, Chip.
<i>assema</i> (= <i>asté-maw</i>), Blackfoot <i>pi-stã-kan</i>;
a root which Dr. J. H. Trumbull has satisfactorily identified as
meaning "to drink," the smoke being swallowed and likened to water.
"To drink tobacco" was the usual old English expression for "to smoke."</p>

<p class="indent">If this etymology is correct, it leads to the inference
that tobacco also was known to the ancient Algonkins before they
split up into the many nations which we now know, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
furthermore that they must have lived in a region where these
two semi-tropical or wholly tropical plants, Indian corn and
tobacco, had been already introduced and cultivated by some
more ancient race. To conclude that they themselves brought
them from a tropical land, would be too hazardous.</p>

<p class="indent">The pipes in which the tobacco was smoked were called
<i>appooke</i> (modern Delaware <i>o'pahokun'</i>, Cumings' Vocab.)
They were of earthenware and of stone; sometimes, it is said,
of copper. According to Kalm, the ceremonial pipes were
of a red stone, possibly the western pipe stone, and were very
highly prized.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of wild fruits and plants they consumed the esculent and
nutritious tubers on the roots of the Wild Bean, <i>Apios tuberosa</i>,
the large, oval, fleshy roots of the arrow-leaved <i>Sagittaria</i>, the
former of which the Indians called <i>hobbenis</i>, and the latter
<i>katniss</i>, names which they subsequently applied to the
European turnip. They also roasted and ate the acrid
cormus of the Indian turnip, <i>Arum triphyllum</i>, in Delaware
<i>taw-ho</i>, <i>taw-hin</i> or <i>tuck-ah</i>, and collected
for food the seeds of the Golden Club, <i>Orontium aquaticum</i>,
common in the pools along the creeks and rivers. Its native name was
<i>taw-kee</i>.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<h3><i>House Building.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">In their domestic architecture they differed
noticeably from the Iroquois and even the Mohegans. Their houses
were not communal, but each family had its separate residence,
a wattled hut, with rounded top, thatched with mats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
woven of the long leaves of the Indian corn or the stalks of
the sweet flag (<i>Acorus calamus</i>,) or of the bark of trees
(<i>anacon</i>, a mat, Z.) These were built in groups and surrounded
with a palisade to protect the inhabitants from
sudden inroads.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In the centre was sometimes erected a mound of
earth, both as a place of observation and as a location to place
the children and women. The remains of these circular ramparts
enclosing a central mound were seen by the early settlers
at the Falls of the Delaware and up the Lehigh valley.</p>

<h3><i>Manufactures</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The art of the potter was known and extensively
practiced, but did not indicate any unusual proficiency, either
in the process of manufacture or in the methods of decoration,
although the late Mr. F. Peale thought that, in the latter
respect, the Delaware pottery had some claims to a high
rank.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a>
The representation of animal forms was quite unusual,
only some few and inferior examples having been found.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Their skill in manufacturing bead work and feather
mantles, and in dressing deer skins, excited the admiration
of the early voyagers. Although their weapons and utensils
were mostly of stone, there was a considerable supply of
native copper among them, in use as ornaments, for arrow
heads and pipes. Some specimens of it have been found by
Dr. Abbott near Trenton, and by other collectors in Pennsylvania,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>
and its scarcity in modern collections is to be
attributed to its being bought up and melted by the whites
rather than to its limited employment.</p>

<p class="indent">Soap stone was hollowed out with considerable skill,
to form bowls, and the wood of the sassafras tree was highly esteemed
for the same purpose (Kalm).</p>

<p class="indent">The maize was broken up in wooden or stone mortars with
a stone pestle, the native name of which was <i>pocohaac</i>, a word
signifying also the virile member.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Their arms were the war club or tomahawk, <i>tomhickan</i>,
the bow, <i>hattape</i>, and arrow, <i>alluns</i>, the spear,
<i>tanganaoun</i>, and for defence Bishop Ettwein states they
carried a round shield of thick, dried hide.</p>

<p class="indent">The spear was also used for spearing fish, which
they, moreover, knew how to catch with "brush nets," and with
fish hooks made of bone and the dried claws of birds
(Kalm).<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a></p>

<h3><i>Paints and Dyes</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The paints and dyes used by the Lenape and
neighboring Indians were derived both from the vegetable and
mineral realms. From the former they obtained red, white and blue
clays, which were in such extensive demand that the vicinity
of those streams in New Castle county, Delaware, which
are now called White Clay Creek and Red Clay Creek, was
widely known to the natives as <i>Walamink</i>, the Place of Paint.</p>

<p class="indent">The vegetable world supplied a variety of dyes
in the colored juices of plants. These were mixed with the acid
juice of the wild, sweet-scented crab apple (<i>Pyrus coronaria</i>;
in Lenape, <i>tombic'anall</i>), to fix the dye.</p>

<p class="indent">A red was yielded by the root of the <i>Sanguinaria
Canadensis</i>, still called "Indian paint root;" an orange by the root
of <i>Phytolacca decandra</i>, the poke or pocoon; a yellow by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
root of <i>Hydrastis Canadensis</i>; a black by a mixture of sumac
and white walnut bark, etc.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<h3><i>Dogs</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The only domestic animal they possessed was a small
species of dogs with pointed ears. These were called <i>allum</i>,
and were preserved less for protection or for use in hunting
than for food, and especially for ceremonial purposes.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a></p>

<h3><i>Interments</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The custom of common ossuaries for each gens
appears to have prevailed among the Lenape. Gabriel Thomas states
that: "If a person of Note dies very far away from his place
of residence, they will convey his Bones home some considerable
Time after, to be buried there."<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Bishop Ettwein
speaks of mounds for common burial, though he appears to
limit their use to times of war.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">One of these communal graveyards of the Minsis covers an
area of six acres on the Neversink creek,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
while, according to tradition, another of great antiquity and extent
was located on the islands in the Delaware river, above the Water-Gap.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<h3><i>Computation of Time.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The accuracy with which the natives computed time
becomes a subject of prime consideration in a study of their
annals. It would appear that the Eastern Algonkins were
not deficient in astronomical knowledge. Roger Williams
remarks, "they much observe the Starres, and their very
children can give names to many of them;"<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
and the same testimony is borne by Wassenaer. The latter, speaking of
the tribes around New York Harbor, in 1630, says that their
year began with the first moon after the February moon; and
that the time for planting was calculated by the rising of the
constellation Taurus in a certain quarter. They named this
constellation the horned head of some great fictitious animal.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Zeisberger observes that, in his day, the Lenape
did not have a fixed beginning to their year, but reckoned from one
seeding time to another, or from when the corn was ripe, etc.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a>
Nevertheless, they had a word for year, <i>gachtin</i>, and counted
their ages and the sequence of events by yearly periods. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
Chipeways count by winters (<i>pipun-agak</i>, in which the first
word means winter, and the second is a plural form similar to
the Del. <i>gachtin</i>); but the Lenape did not apparently follow
them in this. They recognized only twelve moons in the
year and not thirteen, as did the New England nations; at
least, the names of but twelve months have been preserved.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The day periods were reckoned usually by nights, but it was
not improper to count by "suns" or days.</p>

<h3><i>Pictographic Signs</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The picture writing of the Delawares has been
quite fully described by Zeisberger, Loskiel and Heckewelder. It
was scratched upon stone (Loskiel), or more frequently cut in or
painted upon the bark of trees or pieces of wood. The
colors were chiefly black and red. The system was highly
conventionalized, so that it could readily be understood by
all their tribes, and also by others with whom they came in
contact, the Shawnees, Wyandots, Chipeways, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The subjects had reference not merely to matters of
present interest, but to the former history of their nation, and were
directed "to the preservation of the memory of famous men,
and to the recollection of events and actions of note."
Therefore, their Agamemnons felt no anxiety for the absence
of a Homer, but "confidently reckoned that their noble
deeds would be held in memory long after their bodies had perished."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The material on which the drawings were made
was generally so perishable that few examples have been left to
us. One, a stone about seven inches long, found in central
New Jersey, has been described and figured by Dr. Abbott.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a>
It represents an arrow crossing certain straight lines. Several
"gorgets" (smooth stone tablets pierced with holes for
suspension, and probably used for ceremonial purposes),
stone knives and pebbles, showing inscribed marks and lines,
and rude figures, are engraved in Dr. Abbott's book; others similar
have been seen in Bucks and Berks counties, Pa.</p>

<p class="indent">There was a remarkable series of hieroglyphics,
some eighty in number, on a rock at Safe Harbor, on the Susquehanna.
They have been photographed and described by
Prof. T. C. Porter, of Lancaster, but have yet to be carefully
analyzed.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
From its location, it was probably the work of the Susquehannocks,
and did not belong to the general system of Algonkin pictography.</p>

<p class="indent">If the rude drawings appended to the early treatises
as signatures of native sachems be taken as a guide, little or no
uniformity prevailed in the personal signs. The same chieftain would,
on various occasions, employ symbols differing so
widely that they have no visible relation.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">An interesting incident is recorded by Friend
John Richardson when on a visit to William Penn, at his
manor of Pennsburg, in 1701. Penn asked the Indian
interpreter to give him some idea of what the native notion
of God was. The interpreter, at a loss for words, had
recourse to picture writing, and describing a number of
circles, one inside the other, he pointed to the centre of
the innermost and smallest one, and there, "placed, as he
said, by way of representation, the Great Man."<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
The explanation was striking and suggestive, and hints at the
meaning of the not infrequent symbol of the concentric circles.</p>

<p class="indent">An alleged piece of Delaware pictography is copied by
Schoolcraft<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a>
from the London <i>Archæologia</i>, Vol. IV.
It purports to be an inscription found on the Muskingum river in
1780, and the interpretation is said to have been supplied by
the celebrated Delaware chief, Captain White Eyes (Coquethagechton).
As interpreted, it relates to massacres of the whites
by the Delaware chief, Wingenund, in the border war of 1763.</p>

<p class="indent">There is a tissue of errors here. The pictograph,
"drawn with charcoal and oil on a tree," must have been quite recent,
and is not likely to have referred to events seventeen years
antecedent. There is no evidence that Wingenund took part
in Pontiac's conspiracy, and he was the consistent friend of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
the whites.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a>
Several of the characters are not like Indian
pictographs. And finally, White Eyes, the alleged interpreter
in 1780, had died at Tuscarawas, two years before, Nov. 10th, 1778!<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<h3><i>Record Sticks</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The Algonkin nations very generally preserved their
myths, their chronicles, and the memory of events, speeches, etc.,
by means of marked sticks. As early as 1646, the Jesuit
missionaries in Canada made use of these to teach their converts
the prayers of the Church and their sermons.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The name applied to these record or tally sticks
was, among the Crees and Chipeways, <i>massinahigan</i>, which is
the common word now for book, but which originally meant "a
piece of wood marked with fire," from the verb <i>masinákisan</i>,
I imprint a mark upon it with fire, I burn a mark upon it,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a>
thus indicating the rude beginning of a system of mnemonic
aids. The Lenape words for book, <i>malackhickan</i>, Camp.,
<i>mamalekhican</i> Zeis., were probably from the same root.</p>

<p class="indent">In later days, instead of burning the marks upon the
sticks, they were painted, the colors as well as the figures having
certain conventional meanings.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a></p>

<p class="indent">These sticks are described as about six inches in length,
slender, though varying in shape, and tied up in bundles.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
Such bundles are mentioned by the interpreter Conrad Weiser,
as in use in 1748 when he was on his embassy in the Indian
country.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
The expression, "we tied up in bundles," is translated
by Mr. Heckewelder, <i>olumapisid</i>, and a head chief of
the Lenape, usually called <i>Olomipees</i>, was thus named, apparently
as preserver of such records.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a>
I shall return on a later page to the precise meaning of this term.</p>

<p class="indent">The word signifying to paint was <i>walamén</i>, which
does not appear in western dialects, but is found precisely the same in
the Abnaki, where it is given by Rasles, <i>8ramann</i><a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a>,
which, transliterated into Delaware (where the <i>l</i> is substituted
for the <i>r</i>), would be <i>w'lam'an</i>. From this word came
<i>Wallamünk</i>, the name applied by the natives to a tract in New
Castle county, Delaware, since at that locality they procured supplies
of colored earth, which they employed in painting. It means
"the place of paint."<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Roger Williams, describing the New England Indians,
speaks of "<i>Wunnam</i>, their red painting, which they most
delight in, and is both the Barke of the Fine, as also a red
Earth."<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The word is derived from Narr. <i>wunne</i>, Del. <i>wulit</i>,
Chip. <i>gwanatsch</i> = beautiful, handsome, good, pretty, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">The Indian who had artistically bedaubed his skin
with red, ochreous clay, was esteemed In full dress, and delightful to
look upon. Hence the term <i>wulit</i>, fine, pretty, came to be
applied to the paint itself.</p>

<p class="indent">The custom of using such sticks, painted or notched,
was by no means peculiar to the Delawares. They were familiar
to the Iroquois, and the early travelers found them in common
employment among the southern tribes.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p class="indent">As the art advanced, in place of simple sticks, painted
or notched, wooden tablets came into use, on which the symbols
were scratched or engraved with a sharp flint or knife. Such
are those still in use among the Chipeway, described by Dr.
James as "rude pictures carved on a flat piece of wood;"<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a>
by the native Copway, as "board plates;"<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a>
and more precisely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
by Mr. Schoolcraft, as "a tabular piece of wood, covered on
both sides with a series of devices cut between parallel lines."<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Chipeway terms applied to these devices or symbols
are, according to Mr. Schoolcraft, <i>kekeewin</i>, for those in
ordinary and common use, and <i>kekeenowin</i>, for those connected
with the mysteries, the "meda worship" and the "great
medicine." Both words are evidently from a radical signifying
a mark or sign, appearing in the words given in Baraga's
"Otchipwe Dictionary," <i>kikinawadjiton</i>, I mark it, I put a
certain mark on it, and <i>kikinoamawa</i>, I teach, instruct him.</p>

<h3><i>Moral and Mental Character.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The character of the Delawares was estimated very
differently, even by those who had the best opportunities of
judging. The missionaries are severe upon them. Brainerd
described them as "unspeakably indolent and slothful. They
have little or no ambition or resolution; not one in a
thousand of them that has the spirit of a man."<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a>
No more favorable was the opinion of Zeisberger. He speaks of
their alleged bravery with the utmost contempt, and morally he
puts them down as "the most ordinary and the vilest of
savages."<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps these worthy missionaries measured them by the
standard of the Christian ideal, by which, alas, we all fall wofully short.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Certainly, other competent observers report much more
cheerfully. One of the first explorers of the Delaware,
Captain Thomas Young (1634), describes them as "very
well proportioned, well featured, gentle, tractable and
docile."<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Of their domestic affections, Mr. Heckewelder
writes: "I do not believe that there are any people on earth who
are more attached to their relatives and offspring than these
Indians are."<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Their action toward the Society of Friends in
Pennsylvania indicates a sense of honor and a respect for pledges
which we might not expect. They had learned and well understood
that the Friends were non-combatants, and as such they
never forgot to spare them, even in the bloody scenes of
border warfare.</p>

<p class="indent">"Amidst all the devastating incursions of the
Indians in North America, it is a remarkable fact that no Friend
who stood faithful to his principles in the disuse of all weapons
of war, the cause of which was generally well understood
by the Indians, ever suffered personal molestation from
them."<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The fact that for more than forty years after the
founding of Penn's colony there was not a single murder committed
on a settler by an Indian, itself speaks volumes for their
self-control and moral character. So far from seeking quarrels
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
with the whites they extended them friendly aid and
comfort.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even after they had become embittered and corrupted
by the gross knavery of the whites (for example, the notorious
"long walk,") and the debasing influence of alcohol, such an
authority as Gen. Wm. H. Harrison could write these words
about the Delawares: "A long and intimate knowledge of
them, in peace and war, as enemies and friends, has left upon
my mind the most favorable impression of their character for
bravery, generosity and fidelity to their engagements."<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
More than this, and from a higher source, could scarcely be asked.</p>

<p class="indent">That intellectually they were by no means deficient is
acknowledged by Brainerd himself. "The children," he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
writes, "learn with surprising readiness; their master tells me he
never had an English school that learned, in general, so fast."<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<h3><i>Religious Beliefs</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">With the hints given us in various authors, it is not
difficult to reconstruct the primitive religious notions of the Delawares.
They resembled closely those of the other Algonkin nations,
and were founded on those general mythical principles which,
in my "Myths of the New World," I have shown existed
widely throughout America. These are, the worship of Light,
especially in its concrete manifestations of fire and the sun;
of the Four Winds, as typical of the cardinal points, and as
the rain bringers; and of the Totemic Animal.</p>

<p class="indent">As the embodiment of Light, some spoke of the
sun as a deity,<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
while their fifth and greatest festival was held in honor
of Fire, which they personified, and called the Grandfather
of all Indian nations. They assigned to it twelve divine
assistants, who were represented by so many actors in the
ceremony, with evident reference to the twelve moons or
months of the year, the fire being a type of the heavenly
blaze, the sun.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p class="indent">But both Sun and Fire were only material emblems
of the mystery of Light. This was the "body or fountain of deity,"
which Brainerd said they described to him in terms that he
could not clearly understand; something "all light;" a being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
"<i>in</i> whom the earth, and all things in it, may be seen;" a
"great man, clothed with the day, yea, with the brightest
day, a day of many years, yea, a day of everlasting continuance."
From him proceeded, in him were, to him returned,
all things and the souls of all things.</p>

<p class="indent">Such was the extraordinary doctrine which a converted
priest of the native religion informed Brainerd was the teaching
of the medicine men.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The familiar Algonkin myth of the "Great Hare," which
I have elsewhere shown to be distinctively a myth of Light,<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
was also well known to the Delawares, and they applied to
this animal, also, the appellation of the "Grandfather of
the Indians."<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a>
Like the fire, the hare was considered their
ancestor, and in both instances the Light was meant, fire
being its symbol, and the word for hare being identical with
that of brightness and light.</p>

<p class="indent">As in Mexico and elsewhere, this light or bright ancestor
was the culture hero of their mythology, their pristine instructor
in the arts, and figured in some of their legends as a
white man, who, in some remote time, visited them from the
east, and brought them their civilization.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="indent">I desire to lay especial stress on these proofs of
Light worship among the Delawares, for it has an immediate bearing
on several points in the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>. There are no compounds
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
more frequent in that document than those with the
root signifying "light," "brightness," etc., and this is one
of the evidences of its authenticity.</p>

<p class="indent">Next in order, or rather, parallel with and a
part of the worship of Light, was that of the Four Cardinal Points,
always identified with the Four Winds, the bringers of rain
and sunshine, the rulers of the weather.</p>

<p class="indent">"After the strictest inquiry respecting their notions
of the Deity," says David Brainerd, "I find that in ancient times,
before the coming of the white people, some supposed there
were four invisible powers, who presided over the four corners
of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Montauk Indians of Long Island, a branch
of the Mohegans, also worshiped these four deities, as we are
informed by the Rev Sampson Occum;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
and Captain Argoll found them again in 1616 among the accolents of
the Potomac, close relatives of the Delawares. Their chief told him:
"We have five gods in all, our chief god appears often unto us in
the form of a mighty great hare, the other four have no
visible shape, but are indeed the four winds, which keep the
four corners of the earth."<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p class="indent">These are the fundamental doctrines, the universal <i>credo</i>,
of not only all the Algonkin faiths, but of all or nearly all primitive
American religions.</p>

<p class="indent">This is very far from the popular conception of
Indian religion, with its "Good Spirit" and "Bad Spirit." Such
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
ideas were not familiar to the native mind. Heckewelder,
Brainerd and Loskiel all assure us in positive terms that the
notion of a bad spirit, a "Devil," was wholly unknown
to the aborigines, and entirely borrowed from the whites.
Nor was the Divinity of Light looked upon as a beneficent
father, or anything of that kind. The Indian did not
appeal to him for assistance, as to his
<i>totemic and personal gods</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">These were conceived to be in the form of animals,
and various acts of propitiation to them were performed. Such
acts were not a worship of the animals themselves. Brainerd
explains this very correctly when he says: "They do not
suppose a divine power essential to or inhering in these
creatures, but that some invisible beings, not distinguished
from each other by certain names, but only notionally,
communicate to these animals a great power, and so make
these creatures the immediate authors of good to certain
persons. Hence such a creature becomes <i>sacred</i> to the
person to whom he is supposed to be the immediate author
of good, and through him they must worship the invisible
powers, though to others he is no more than another creature."<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p class="indent">They rarely attempted to set forth the divinity in
image. The rude representation of a human head, cut in wood, small
enough to be carried on the person, or life size on a post, was
their only idol. This was called <i>wsinkhoalican</i>. They also
drew and perhaps carved emblems of their totemic guardian.
Mr. Beatty describes the head chief's home as a long building
of wood: "Over the door a turtle is drawn, which is the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
ensign of this particular tribe. On each door post was cut
the face of a grave old man."<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Occasionally, rude representations of the human head,
chipped out of stone, are exhumed in those parts of Pennsylvania
and New Jersey once inhabited by the Lenape.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
These are doubtless the <i>wsinkhoalican</i> above mentioned.</p>

<h3><i>Doctrine of the Soul</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">There was a general belief in a soul, spirit or immaterial
part of man. For this the native words were <i>tschipey</i> and
<i>tschitschank</i> (in Brainerd, <i>chichuny</i>). The former
is derived from a root signifying to be separate or apart, while
the latter means "the shadow."<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Their doctrine was that after death the soul went
<i>south</i>, where it would enjoy a happy life for a certain term,
and then could return and be born again into the world. In
moments of spiritual illumination it was deemed possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
recall past existences, and even to remember the happy epoch
passed in the realm of bliss.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The path to this abode of the blessed was by the
Milky Way, wherein the opinion of the Delawares coincided with
that of various other American nations, as the Eskimos, on
the north, and the Guaranis of Paraguay, on the south.</p>

<p class="indent">The ordinary euphemism to inform a person that his
death was at hand was: "You are about to visit your ancestors;"<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
but most observers agree that they were a timorous people,
with none of that contempt of death sometimes assigned
them.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

<h3><i>The Native Priests.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">An important class among the Lenape were those
called by the whites doctors, conjurers, or medicine men, who were
really the native priests. They appear to have been of two
schools, the one devoting themselves mainly to divination,
the other to healing.</p>

<p class="indent">According to Brainerd, the title of the former among
the Delawares, as among the New England Indians, was <i>powwow</i>,
a word meaning "a dreamer;" Chip., <i>bawadjagan</i>, a dream;
<i>nind apawe</i>, I dream; Cree, <i>pawa-miwin</i>, a dream. They
were the interpreters of the dreams of others, and themselves
claimed the power of dreaming truthfully of the future and
the absent.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a>
In their visions their guardian spirit visited
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
them; they became, in their own words, "all light," and
they "could see through men, and knew the thoughts of
their hearts."<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a>
At such times they were also instructed at
what spot the hunters could successfully seek game.</p>

<p class="indent">The other school of the priestly class was called,
as we are informed by Mr. Heckewelder, <i>medeu</i>.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
This is the same term which we find in Chipeway as <i>mide</i>
(<i>medaween</i>, Schoolcraft), and in Cree as <i>mitew</i>,
meaning a conjurer, a member of the Great Medicine Lodge.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
I suspect the word is from <i>m'iteh</i>, heart (Chip. <i>k'ide</i>,
thy heart), as this organ was considered the source and centre of life
and the emotions, and is constantly spoken of in a figurative sense in
Indian conversation and oratory.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the natives around New York Bay there was
a body of conjurers who professed great austerity of life. They had
no fixed homes, pretended to absolute continence, and both
exorcised sickness and officiated at the funeral rites. Their
name, as reported by the Dutch, was <i>kitzinacka</i>, which is
evidently Great Snake (<i>gitschi</i>, <i>achkook</i>). The interesting
fact is added, that at certain periodical festivals a sacrifice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
was prepared, which it was believed was carried off by a huge
serpent.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When the missionaries came among the Indians, the
shrewd and able natives who had been accustomed to practice on the
credulity of their fellows recognized that the new faith would
destroy their power, and therefore they attacked it vigorously.
Preachers arose among them, and claimed to have had communications
from the Great Spirit about all the matters which
the Christian teachers talked of. These native exhorters
fabricated visions and revelations, and displayed symbolic
drawings on deerskins, showing the journey of the soul after
death, the path to heaven, the twelve emetics and purges
which would clean a man of sin, etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Such were the famed prophets Papunhank and Wangomen,
who set up as rivals in opposition to David Zeisberger; and
such those who so constantly frustrated the efforts of the
pious Brainerd. Often do both of these self-sacrificing apostles
to the Indians complain of the evil influence which such
false teachers exerted among the Delawares.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The existence of this class of impostors is significant
for the appreciation of such a document as the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>.
They were partially acquainted with the Bible history of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
creation; some had learned to read and write in the mission
schools; they were eager to imitate the wisdom of the whites,
while at the same time they were intent on claiming authentic
antiquity and originality for all their sayings.</p>

<h3><i>Religious Ceremonies.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The principal sacred ceremony was the dance and
accompanying song. This was called <i>kanti kanti</i>, from a verbal
found in most Algonkin dialects with the primary meaning
to sing (Abnaki, <i>skan</i>, je danse et chante en même temps,
Rasles; Cree, <i>nikam</i>; Chip., <i>nigam</i>, I sing). From this
noisy rite, which seems to have formed a part of all the native
celebrations, the settlers coined the word <i>cantico</i>,
which has survived and become incorporated into the English tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">Zeisberger describes other festivals, some five
in number. The most interesting is that called <i>Machtoga</i>,
which he translates "to sweat." This was held in honor of
"their Grandfather, the Fire." The number twelve appears in
it frequently as regulating the actions and numbers of the performers.
This had evident reference to the twelve months of the year,
but his description is too vague to allow a satisfactory analysis
of the rite.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>Literature of the Lenape Tongue.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The first study of the Delaware language was
undertaken by the Rev. Thomas Campanius (Holm), who was chaplain
to the Swedish settlements, 1642-1649. He collected a vocabulary,
wrote out a number of dialogues in Delaware and
Swedish, and even completed a translation of the Lutheran
catechism into the tongue. The last mentioned was published
in Stockholm, in 1696, through the efforts of his grandson,
under the title, <span class="smcap">Lutheri Catechismus</span>, <i>Ofwersatt
pä American-Virginiske Spräket</i>, 1 vol., sm. 8vo, pp. 160.
On pages 133-154 it has a <i>Vocabularium Barbaro-Virgineorum</i>,
and on pages 155-160, <i>Vocabula Mahakuassica</i>. The first is the
Delaware as then current on the lower river, the second the dialect
of the Susquehannocks or Minquas, who frequently visited the
Swedish settlements.</p>

<p class="indent">Although he managed to render all the Catechism
into something which looks like Delaware, Campanius' knowledge
of the tongue was exceedingly superficial. Dr. Trumbull
says of his work: "The translator had not learned even so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
much of the grammar as to distinguish the plural of a noun
or verb from the singular, and knew nothing of the "transitions"
by which the pronouns of the subject and object are
blended with the verb."<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

<p class="indent">At the close of his "History of New Sweden," Campanius
adds further linguistic material, including an imaginary conversation
in Lenape, and the oration of a sachem. It is of
the same character as that found in the Catechism.</p>

<p class="indent">After the English occupation very little attention
was given to the tongue beyond what was indispensable to trading.
William Penn, indeed, professed to have acquired a mastery
of it. He writes: "I have made it my business to understand
it, that I might not want an interpreter on any occasion."<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a>
But it is evident, from the specimens he gives, that all he studied
was the trader's jargon, which scorned etymology, syntax and prosody,

periods of Macaulay.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">An ample specimen of this jargon is furnished us
by Gabriel Thomas, in his "Historical and Geographical Account of
the Province and Country of Pensilvania; and of West-New-Jersey
in America," London, 1698, dedicated to Penn.
Thomas tells us that he lived in the country fifteen years,
and supplies, for the convenience of those who propose visiting
the province, some forms of conversation, Indian and
English. I subjoin a short specimen, with a brief commentary:&mdash;

<p class="indent">The principal authority on the Delaware language
is the Rev. David Zeisberger, the eminent Moravian missionary,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
whose long and devoted labors may be accepted as fixing the
standard of the tongue.</p>

<p class="indent">Before him, no one had seriously set to work to master
the structure of the language, and reduce it to a uniform orthography.
With him, it was almost a lifelong study, as for more
than sixty years it engaged his attention. To his devotion
to the cause in which he was engaged, he added considerable
natural talent for languages, and learned to speak, with almost
equal fluency, English, German, Delaware and the Onondaga
and Mohawk dialects of the Iroquois.</p>

<p class="indent">The first work he gave to the press was a
"Delaware Indian and English Spelling Book for the Schools of
the Mission of the United Brethren," printed in Philadelphia,
1776. As he did not himself see the proofs, he complained
that both in its arrangement and typographical
accuracy it was disappointing. Shortly before his death,
in 1806, the second edition appeared, amended in these
respects. A "Hymn Book," in Delaware, which he finished
in 1802, was printed the following year, and the last work
of his life, a translation into Delaware of Lieberkuhn's
"History of Christ," was published at New York in 1821.</p>

<p class="indent">These, however, formed but a small part of the
manuscript materials he had prepared on and in the language. The
most important of these were his Delaware Grammar, and his
Dictionary in four languages, English, German, Onondaga
and Delaware.</p>

<p class="indent">The MS. of the Grammar was deposited in the Archives
of the Moravian Society at Bethlehem, Pa. A translation of it
was prepared by Mr. Peter Stephen Duponceau, and published
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
in the "Transactions of the American Philosophical Society," in 1827.</p>

<p class="indent">The quadrilingual dictionary has never been printed.
The MS. was presented, along with others, in 1850, to the library
of Harvard College, where it now is. The volume is an
oblong octavo of 362 pages, containing about 9000 words
in the English and German columns, but not more than half
that number in the Delaware.</p>

<p class="indent">A number of other MSS. of Zeisberger are also
in that library, received from the same source. Among these are
a German-Delaware Glossary, containing 51 pages and about
600 words; a Delaware-German Phrase Book of about 200
pages; Sermons in Delaware, etc., mostly incomplete studies,
but of considerable value to the student of the tongue.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Associated with Zeisberger for many years was
the genial Rev. John Heckewelder, so well known for his pleasant
"History of the Indian Nations of Pennsylvania," his interpretations
of the Indian names of the State, and his correspondence
with Mr. Duponceau. He certainly had a fluent,
practical knowledge of the Delaware, but it has repeatedly
been shown that he lacked analytical power in it, and that
many of his etymologies as well as some of his grammatical
statements are erroneous.</p>

<p class="indent">Another competent Lenapist was the Rev. Johannes
Roth. He was born in Prussia in 1726, and educated a Catholic.
Joining the Moravians in 1748, he emigrated to America in
1756, and in 1759 took charge of the missionary station called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
Schechschiquanuk, on the west bank of the Susquehanna,
opposite and a little below Shesequin, in Bradford county,
Pennsylvania. There he remained until 1772, when, with
his flock, fifty-three in number, he proceeded to the new
Gnadenhütten, in Ohio. There a son was born to him, the
first white child in the area of the present State of Ohio. In
1774 he returned to Pennsylvania, and after occupying various
pastorates, he died at York, July 22d, 1791.</p>

<p class="indent">Roth has left us a most important work, and one
hitherto entirely unknown to bibliographers. He made an especial
study of the <i>Unami dialect</i> of the Lenape, and composed in
it an extensive religious work, of which only the fifth part
remains. It is now in the possession of the American
Philosophical Society, and bears the title:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent space-above2">The next page begins, "Der fünfte Theil,"
and § 86, and proceeds to § 139. It forms a quarto volume, of title,
9 pages of contents in German and English, and 268 pages of text
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
in Unami, written in a clear hand, with many corrections
and interlineations.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the only work known to me as composed distinctively
in the Unami, and its value is proportionately great as providing
the means of studying this, the acknowledged most cultivated and
admired of the Lenape dialects.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be the task of some future Lenape scholar to edit
its text and analyze its grammatical forms. But I believe that Algonkin students
will be glad to see at this time an extract from its pages.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">I select § 96, which is the parable of the marriage
feast of the king's son, as given in Matthew xxii, 1-14.</p>

<p class="indent">The Moravian Bishop, John Ettwein, was another of
their fraternity who applied himself to the study of the Delaware.
Born in Europe in 1712, he came to the New World in 1754,
and died at the great age of ninety years in 1802. He prepared
a small dictionary and phrase book, especially rich in
verbal forms. It is an octavo MS. of 88 pages, without title,
and comprises about 1300 entries. This manuscript exists in
one copy only, in the Moravian Archives at Bethlehem.</p>

<p class="indent">Bishop Ettwein also prepared for General Washington,
in 1788, an account of the traditions and language of the natives,
including a vocabulary. This was found among the Washington
papers by Mr. Jared Sparks, and was published in the
"Bulletin of the Pennsylvania Historical Society," 1848.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the most laborious of the Moravian missionaries
was the Rev. Adam Grube. His life spanned nearly a century,
from 1715, when he was born in Germany, until 1808,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
when he died in Bethlehem, Pa. Many years of this were
spent among the Delawares in Pennsylvania and Ohio. He
was familiar with their language, but the only evidence of his
study of it that has come to my knowledge is a MS. in the
Harvard College Library, entitled, "Einige Delawarische
Redensarten und Worte." It has seventy-five useful leaves,
the entries without alphabetic arrangement, some of the verbs
accompanied by partial inflections. The only date it bears
is "Oct. 10, 1800," when he presented it to the Rev. Mr.
Luckenbach, soon to be mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">After the War of 1812 the Moravian brother,
Rev. C. F. Dencke, who, ten years before had attempted to teach
the Gospel to the Chipeways, gathered together the scattered
converts among the Delawares at New Fairfield, Canada West.
In 1818 he completed and forwarded to the Publication Board
of the American Bible Society a translation of the Epistles
of John, which was published the same year.</p>

<p class="indent">He also stated to the Board that at that time he had
finished a translation of John's Gospel and commenced that of Matthew,
both of which he expected to send to the Board in that year.
A donation of one hundred dollars was made to him to encourage
him in his work, but for some reason the prosecution
of his labors was suspended, and the translation of the Gospels
never appeared (contrary to the statements in some bibliographies).</p>

<p class="indent">It is probable that Mr. Dencke was the compiler
of the Delaware Dictionary which is preserved in the Moravian
Archives at Bethlehem. The MS. is an oblong octavo, in a
fine, but beautifully clear hand, and comprises about 3700
words. The handwriting is that of the late Rev. Mr. Kampman,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
from 1840 to 1842 missionary to the Delawares on the
Canada Reservation. On inquiring the circumstances connected
with this MS., he stated to me that it was written at
the period named, and was a copy of some older work, probably
by Mr. Dencke, but of this he was not certain.</p>

<p class="indent">While the greater part of this dictionary is
identical in words and rendering with the second edition of Zeisberger's
"Spelling Book" (with which I have carefully compared it),
it also includes a number of other words, and the whole is
arranged in accurate alphabetical order.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Dencke also prepared a grammar of the Delaware,
as I am informed by his old personal friend, Rev. F. R. Holland,
of Hope, Indiana; but the most persistent inquiry through
residents at Salem, N. C., where he died in 1839, and at the
Missionary Archives at Bethlehem, Pa., and Moraviantown,
Canada, have failed to furnish me a clue to its whereabouts.
I fear that this precious document was "sold as paper stock,"
as I am informed were most of the MSS. which he left at his
decease! A sad instance of the total absence of intelligent
interest in such subjects in our country.</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Abraham Luckenbach may be called the
last of the Moravian Lenapists. With him, in 1854, died out the
traditions of native philology. Born in 1777, in Lehigh
county, Pennsylvania, he became a missionary among the
Indians in 1800, and until his retirement, forty-three years
later, was a zealous pastor to his flock on the White river,
Indiana, and later, on the Canada Reservation. His published
work is entitled "Forty-six Select Scripture Narratives
from the Old Testament, embellished with Engravings, for
the Use of Indian Youth. Translated into Delaware Indian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
by A. Luckenbach. New York. Printed by Daniel Fanshaw,
1838." 8vo, pp. xvi, 304.</p>

<p class="indent">After his retirement in Bethlehem, he edited, in
1847, the second edition of Zeisberger's "Collection of Hymns," the
first of which has already been mentioned.</p>

<p class="indent">A short MS. vocabulary, in German and Delaware,
is in the possession of his family, in Bethlehem, and some loose
papers in the language.</p>

<p class="indent">One of the most recent students of the Delaware was
Mr. Matthew G. Henry, of Philadelphia. In 1859 and 1860 he compiled,
with no little labor, a "Delaware Indian Dictionary," the
MS. of which, in the library of the American Philosophical Society,
forms a thick quarto volume of 843 pages, with a number of maps.
It is in three parts; 1, English and Delaware; 2, Delaware and English;
3, Delaware Proper Names and their Translations.</p>

<p class="indent">It includes, without analysis or correction, the words in
Zeisberger's "Spelling Book," Roger William's "Key," Companius' Vocabulary,
those in Smith's and Strachey's "Virginia" and various Nanticoke, Mohegan,
Minsi and other vocabularies. The derivations of the proper names are
chiefly from Heckewelder, and in other cases are venturesome.
The compilation, therefore, while often useful, lacks the salutary check
of a critical, grammatical erudition, and in its present form is
of limited value.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the later vocabularies collected by various
travelers offer points for comparison, and may be mentioned here.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In 1786 Major Denny<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a>
at Fort McIntosh, Ohio, collected a number of Delaware words,
principally from Shawnee Indians. A comparison shows many of them
to be in a corrupt form, owing either to the ignorance of the Shawnee
authority, or to the inaccuracy of Major Denny in catching the sounds.</p>

<p class="indent">While engaged on the Pacific Railroad survey, in 1853,
Lieut. Whipple<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a>
collected a vocabulary of a little over 200
words from a Delaware chief, named Black Beaver, in the
Indian Territory, which was edited, in 1856, by Prof. Turner.
It is evidently a pure specimen, and, as the editor observes,
"agrees remarkably" with earlier authentic vocabularies.</p>

<p class="indent">In the second volume of Schoolcraft's large work<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
is a vocabulary of about 350 words, obtained by Mr. Cummings,
U. S. Indian Agent. The precise source, date and locality
are not given, but it is evidently from some trustworthy
native, and is quite correct.</p>

<p class="indent">Some small works for the schools of the Baptist
missions among the Delawares in Kansas were prepared by the Rev.
J. Meeker. They appear to be entirely elementary in character.</p>

<p class="indent">It will be observed that in this list not a single
native writer is named. So far as I have ascertained, though many
learned to write their native tongue, not one attempted any composition
in it beyond the needs of daily life.</p>

<p class="indent space-below2">To make some amends for this, and as I wished to
obtain an example of the Lenape of to-day, I asked Chief Gottlieb
Tobias, an educated native on the Moravian Reservation in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
Canada, to give me in writing his opinion of the Delaware
text of the <span class="smcap">Walum Olum</span>, which I had sent him.
This he obligingly did, and added a translation of his letter. The
two are as follows, without alteration:&mdash;</p>

<p class="author"><br /><span class="smcap">Moraviantown</span>, Sept. 26, 1884.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>I, <span class="smcap">Gottlieb Tobias</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">Nanne ni ngutschi nachguttemin, jun awen eet ma elekhigetup.

<p class="indent">Then I will try to answer this (which) some one at some time
wrote. And some I understand, and some not, because his language
is called Wonalatoko, half Unami and half another language. I
do not understand it. Long ago my grandfather about 48 years
ago I heard it that language. One man and one old woman and
now another old woman here lives yet who uses this Wonalatoko
language just like this book and she said, I of old time when I was
a child heard more difficult dialect than the present, and many at
that time partly Unami he speak, but sometimes also partly
Minsi he speak.</p></div>

<p class="indent space-above2">The drift of Chief Tobias' letter is highly
important to this present work, though his expressions are not couched in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
the most perfect English. It will be noted that he recognizes
the text of the <span class="smcap">Walum Olum</span> to be a native
production composed in one of the ancient southern dialects of the
tongue, the Unami (Wonami) or the Unalachtgo (Wonalatoko). I
shall recur to this when discussing the authenticity of that
document on a later page.</p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>General Remarks on the Lenape.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The Lenape language is a well-defined and quite
pure member of the great Algonkin stock, revealing markedly the
linguistic traits of this group, and standing philologically,
as well as geographically, between the Micmac of the extreme
east and the Chipeway of the far West.</p>

<p class="indent">These linguistic traits, common to the whole
stock, I may briefly enumerate as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">1. All words are derived from simple, monosyllabic
roots, by means of affixes and suffixes.</p>

<p class="indent">2. The words do not come within the grammatical
categories of the Aryan language, as nouns, adjectives, verbs and
other "parts of speech," but are "indifferent themes," which
may be used at will as one or the other. To this there
appear to be a few exceptions.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Expressions of being (<i>i.e.</i>, nominal themes)
undergo modifications depending on the ontological conception as
to whether the thing spoken of is a living or a lifeless
object. This forms the "animate and inanimate," or the
"noble and ignoble" declensions and conjugations. The
distinction is not strictly logical, but largely grammatical,
many lifeless objects being considered living, and the
reverse. This is the only modification of the kind known,
true grammatical gender not appearing in any of these tongues.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">4. Expressions of action (<i>i. e.</i>, verbal themes)
undergo modifications depending on the abstract assumption as to
whether the action is real or conjectural. If the latter, it is
indicated by a change in the vowel of the root. This leads
to a fundamental division of verbal modes into <i>positive</i> and
<i>suppositive</i> modes.</p>

<p class="indent">5. The expression of action is subordinate to that
of being, so that the verbal elements of a proposition are secondary to
the nominal or pronominal elements, and the subjective relation
becomes closely akin to, or identical with, that of possession.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a></p>

<p class="indent">6. The conception of number is feebly developed in
its application to inanimate objects, which often have no grammatical
plurals. The inclusive and exclusive plurals are used
in the first person.</p>

<p class="indent">7. The genius of the language is <i>holophrastic</i>&mdash;that
is, its effort is to express the relationship of several ideas by combining
them in one word. This is displayed: 1, in nominal
themes, by <i>polysynthesis</i>, by which several such themes are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
welded into one, according to fixed laws of elision and
euphony; and 2, by <i>incorporation</i>, where the object (or a
pronoun representing it) and the subject are united with the
verb, forming the so-called "transitions," or "objective conjugations."</p>

<p class="indent">8. There is no relative pronoun, so that the relation
of minor to major clauses is left to be indicated either by position
or the offices of a simple connective.</p>

<p class="indent">9. The language of both sexes is identical, those
differences of speech between the males and females, so frequently
observed in other American tongues, finding no place in the
Algonkin.</p>

<p class="indent">10. No independent verb-substantive is found,
and, as might be anticipated, no means of predicating existence
apart from quality and attribute.</p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>Dialects of the Lenape.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">Two slightly different dialects prevailed among
the Delawares themselves, the one spoken by the Unami and Unalachtgo,
the other by the Minsi. The former is stated by the
Moravian missionaries to have had an uncommonly soft and
pleasant sound to the ear<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a>,
and William Penn made the same remark. It was also considered to be
the purer and more elegant dialect, and was preferred by the
missionaries as the vehicle for their translations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Minsi was harsher and more difficult to learn,
but would seem to have been the more archaic branch, as it is
stated to be a key to the other, and to preserve many words
in their integrity and original form, which in the Unami were
abbreviated or altogether dropped. The Minsi dialect was
closely akin to the Mohegan.</p>

<p class="indent">How far the separation of the Delaware dialects
had extended may be judged from the subjoined list of words. They
are selected, as showing the greatest variation, from a list of
over one hundred, prepared by Mr. Heckewelder for the
American Philosophical Society, and preserved in MS. in its library.</p>

<p class="indent">The comparison proves that the differences are far
from extensive, and chiefly result from a greater use of gutturals.</p>

<p class="indent space-above2">A noteworthy difference in the Northern and
Southern Lenape dialects was that the latter possessed the three phonetic
elements <i>n</i>, <i>l</i> and <i>r</i>, while the former could
not pronounce the <i>r</i>, and their neighbors, the Mohegans,
neither the <i>l</i> nor the <i>r</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The dialect studied by Campanius and Penn, and
that in southern New Jersey presented the <i>r</i> sound where the
Upper Unami and Minsi had the <i>l</i>. Thus Campanius gives
<i>rhenus</i>, for <i>lenno</i>, man; and Penn <i>oret</i>,
for the Unami <i>wulit</i>, good.</p>

<p class="indent">The dialectic substitution of one of these elements
for another is a widespread characteristic of Algonkin phonology.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Roger Williams early called attention to it among the tribes
of New England.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Tracing it to its origin, it clearly arises from the
use of "alternating consonants," so extensive in American languages.
In very many of them it is optional with the speaker
to employ any one of several sounds of the same class. This
is the case with these letters in Cree, which, for various
reasons, may be considered the most archaic of all the Algonkin
dialects. In its phonetics, the <i>th</i>, <i>y</i>, <i>l</i>,
<i>n</i> and <i>r</i> are "permuting" or "alternating" letters.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Often, too, the sound falls between these letters,
so that the foreign ear is left in doubt which to write.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">That this is the case with the Delaware is evident
from some of the more recent vocabularies where the <i>r</i> is not
infrequent. The following words, from the vocabulary in
Major Denny's <i>Memoir</i>, illustrate this:&mdash;</p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="2" summary="_" cellpadding="0" >

      <td class="tdl">Stone</td>

      <td class="tdl"><i>hoqrunog</i>, etc.</td>
    </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>

<p class="indent space-above1">Even Mr. Lewis A. Morgan, who had considerable
practice in writing the sounds of the Indian languages, inserts the <i>r</i>
in a number of pure Delaware words he collected in Kansas.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Another difficulty presents itself in the sibilants.
They are not always distinguished.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Horatio Hale writes me on this point: "In
Minsi, and perhaps in all the Lenape dialects, the sound written <i>s</i> is
intermediate between <i>s</i> and <i>th</i> (the Greek <i>Θ</i>). This
element is pronounced by placing the tongue and teeth in the position
of the theta, and then endeavoring to utter <i>s</i>".</p>

<p class="indent">The guttural, represented in the Moravian vocabularies
by <i>ch</i>, was softened by the English likewise to the <i>s</i> sound, as
it appears also to have been by the New Jersey tribes.<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p class="indent">In connection with dialectic variation,
the interesting question arises as to the rapidity of change in
language. With regard to the Lenape we are enabled to compare this
for a period covering more than two centuries. To test it, I have
arranged the subjoined table of words culled from three writers
at about equidistant points in this period. Each wrote in the
orthography of his own tongue, and this I have not altered.
The words from Campanius are from the southern dialect,
which preferred the <i>r</i> to the <i>l</i>, and this substitution
should be allowed for in a fair comparison.

<p class="indent">I have no doubt that if a Swede, a German and an
Englishman were to-day to take down these words from the mouth
of a Delaware Indian, each writing them in the orthography
of his own tongue, the variations would be as numerous as
in the above list, except, perhaps, the ancient and now disused
<i>r</i> sound. The comparison goes to show that there has
probably been but a very slight change in the Delaware, in
spite of the many migrations and disturbances they have
undergone. They speak the language of their forefathers as
closely as do the English, although no written documents
have aided them in keeping it alive. This is but another
proof added to an already long list, showing that the belief
that American languages undergo rapid changes is an error.</p>

<p class="indent">The dialect which the Moravian missionaries learned,
and in which they composed their works, was that of the Lehigh
Valley. That it was not an impure Minsi mixed with Mohegan,
as Dr. Trumbull seems to think,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a>
is evident from the direct statements of the missionaries themselves,
as well as from Heckewelder's Minsi vocabularies, which show many
points of divergence from the printed books. Moreover,
among the first converts from the Delaware nation were
members of the Unami or Turtle tribe, and Zeisberger was
brought into immediate contact with them.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>
We may fairly consider it to have been the upper or inland Unami,
which, as I have said, was recognized by the nation as the purest,
or at least the most polished dialect of their tongue. It stood midway
between the Unalachtgo and Southern Unami and the true Minsi.

<h3>§ 4. <i>Special Structure of the Lenape.</i></h3>

<p class="indent"><i>The Root and the Formation of the Theme.</i>&mdash;As
they appear in the language of to-day, the Lenape radicals are chiefly
monosyllables, which undergo more or less modifications
in composition. They cannot be used alone, the tongue
having long since passed from that interjectional condition
where each of these roots conveyed a whole sentence in itself.</p>

<p class="indent">Whether they can be resolved back into a few
elementary sounds, primitive elements of speech, I shall not discuss.
This has been done for the Cree roots by Mr. Joseph Howse,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a>
and most of the radicals of that tongue are identical with
those of the Lenape. Some of his conclusions appear to me
hazardous and hypothetical; and certainly many of his supposed
analogies drawn from European tongues are extravagant.</p>

<p class="indent">As in other idioms, so in Lenape, two or more
radicals may be compounded to form a combination, which, in turn,
performs the offices of a radical in the construction of themes.</p>

<p class="indent">This combination is formed either by prefixes or
suffixes. The prefixes are generally adjectival in signification, while
the suffixes are usually classificatory. A number of these are
secondary roots, which are themselves capable of further analysis.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">As so much of the strength of the languages depends on
this plan of word building, I have drawn off a list of a few of the
more frequent affixes of the Lenape, with their signification:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent space-above1"><i>Lenape Prefixes.</i></p>
<p>
<i>awoss-</i>,&nbsp; beyond, the other side of.<br />
<i>eluwi-</i>,&nbsp; most, a superlative form.<br />

<i>kit-</i>,&nbsp; great, large.<br />
<i>lappi-</i>,&nbsp; again, indicates repetition.<br />
<i>lenno-</i>,&nbsp; male, man.<br />
<i>lippoe-</i>,&nbsp; wise, shrewd; as <i>lippoeweno</i>, a shrewd man.<br />
<i>mach-</i>,&nbsp; evil, bad, hurt.<br />
<i>matt-</i>,&nbsp; negative and depreciatory;<br />
<span class="m-left_5">as <i>mattaptonen</i>, to speak uncivilly.</span><br />

<i>ochque-</i>,&nbsp; she, female.<br />
<i>pach-</i>,&nbsp; division, separation; <i>pachican</i>, a knife;<br />
<span class="m-left_5"><i>pachat</i>, to split.</span><br />

<i>wit-</i>,&nbsp; with or in common.<br />
<i>wul-</i>, or <i>wel-</i>,&nbsp; <a href="#Page_104">see page 104</a>.
</p>

<p class="indent">Many of these are abbreviated to the extent that a single
significant letter is all that remains, as <i>min</i> in <i>msim</i>,
hickory nut; <i>pakihm</i>, cranberry; and so <i>acki</i> to <i>k</i>,
<i>hanne</i> to <i>an</i>, as <i>kitanink</i> (Kittanning), from
<i>gitschi</i>, great; <i>hanne</i>, flowing river; <i>ink</i>,
locative, "at the place of the great river."</p>

<p class="indent space-above1">The analysis of a series of derivatives from the same
root offers a most instructive subject for investigation in the Lenape.
Not only does it reveal the linguistic processes adapted, but
it discloses the psychology of the native mind, and teaches
us the associations of its ideas, and the range of its imaginative
powers. By no other avenue can we gain access to the
intimate thought-life of this people. Here it is unfolded to
us by evidence which is irrefragable.</p>

<p class="indent">These considerations lead me to present a few
examples of the derivatives from roots of different classes.</p>

<p class="indent">The strangely conflicting ideas evolved from this root
already attracted the attention of Mr. Duponceau<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>.
That the notions for freedom and servitude, murderer and Saviour,
should be expressed by modifications of the same radical is
indeed striking! But the psychological process through which
it came about is evident on studying the above arrangement.</p>

<p class="center space-above1"><i>Grammatical Structure of the Lenape.</i></p>

<p class="indent">It would not be worth while for me to enter into
the intricacies of Lenape grammar, particularly as I can add little
to what is already known.</p>

<p class="indent">The Delaware Grammar of Zeisberger remains our only
authority, and in spite of its manifest shortcomings and state
of incompletion, the unprejudiced student must acknowledge,
with Albert Gallatin<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>,
that it is "most honestly done," and
showed the Delaware as it actually was spoken, though perhaps
not as scientific linguists think it ought to have been spoken.</p>

<p class="indent">A few general observations will be sufficient.</p>

<p class="indent">As in other languages of the class, the theme is indifferently
nominal, verbal or adjectival; that is, it performs the functions
of either of these grammatical categories, according to its connection.</p>

<p class="indent">Nominal themes are either animate or inanimate.
The characteristic of all animate plurals is <i>k</i> (<i>ak</i>,
<i>ik</i>, <i>ek</i>). Inanimate plurals are in <i>al</i>,
<i>wall</i> or <i>a</i>. As usual, the distinction
between animate and inanimate nouns is partly logical, partly
grammatical, various objects being conceived as animate which
are in fact not so.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The possessive relation is generally indicated by
placement alone, the possessor preceding the thing possessed, as
<i>lenno quisall</i>, the man's son; but one could also say
<i>lenno w'quisall</i>, the man his son.</p>

<p class="indent">Adjectives precede nouns, and when used attributively
assume a verbal form by adding the termination <i>wi</i>, which
indicates objective existence (like the Chip. <i>-win</i>). Thus,
<i>scattek</i>, burning; <i>scattewi w'dehin</i>,
a burning-heart&mdash;literally, it-is-a-burning-thing his-heart.</p>

<p class="indent">The degrees of comparison are formed by prefixing <i>allowiwi</i>,
more, and <i>eluwi</i>, most. Both of these are from the same radical
<i>ala</i> which may perhaps come from the <i>admirationis
particula</i>, <i>ala'</i> (Abnaki, <i>ara'</i>) found in the northern
dialects as expressive of astonishment<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">There being no relative pronoun in Delaware, dependent
clauses are either included in the verbal of the major clause,
or include it as a secondary.</p>

<p class="indent">The scheme of the simple sentence is usually subject-verb-object;
but emphasis allows departures from this, as in the following
sentence from Bishop Ettwein's MSS.:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Jesus&emsp; wemi&emsp; amemensall&emsp;  w'taholawak.</i><br />
&emsp; Jesus&emsp; &emsp;all&emsp; &emsp;children&emsp; &emsp;he-loved-them.</p>

<p class="indent">Of the formal affixes, the inseparable pronouns are the
most prominent. They are the same for nouns and verbs, and are&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="m-left_5">1st. <i>n</i>,&nbsp; I, my, we, our.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5">2d.&nbsp; <i>k</i>,&nbsp; thou, thy, you, your.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5">3d.&nbsp; <i>w</i>&nbsp; or <i>o</i>,&nbsp; he, she, it, his, their.</span><br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Past time is indicated by the terminal <i>p</i>, with a
connective vowel, and future time by <i>tsch</i>, which may be either a
prefix or suffix, as&mdash;</p>

<p>
<span class="m-left_5"><i>N'dellsin</i>,&nbsp; &nbsp;  I am thus.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5"><i>N'dellsineep</i>,&nbsp; I was thus.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5"><i>N'dellsintschi</i>,&emsp; &nbsp;}</span><br />
<span class="m-left_4">or&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;&nbsp;}&emsp; I shall be thus.</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5"><i>Nantsch n'dellsin</i>, }</span><br />
</p>

<p class="indent">The change or "flattening" of the vowel of the root
in suppositive propositions, was recognized as a fact of speech,
but not grammatically analyzed by Zeisberger.</p>

<p class="indent">Its effect on verbal forms may be seen from the
following examples from his <i>Grammar</i>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><i>Examples of Vowel Change in Lenape.</i></p>

<table border="0" cellspacing="2" summary="_" cellpadding="0" >

<p class="indent">Another omission in his Grammar is that of the
"obviative" and "super-obviative" forms of nouns. These are
used in the Algonkin dialects to define the relations of third
persons. They prevent such obscurity as appears in the
following English sentence: "John's brother called at Robert's,
to see his wife." Whose wife is referred to is left
ambiguous; but in Algonkin these third persons would have
different forms, and there would be no room for ambiguity.
In his writings in Lenape, Zeisberger makes use of obviatives,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
with the terminations <i>al</i> and <i>l</i>, but does not treat of them in
his Grammar.</p>

<p class="indent">As a question in philosophical grammar, it may
be doubted whether the Lenape has any true passive voice. Cardinal
Mezzofanti was accustomed to deny the presence of any real
passives in American languages; and he had studied the
Delaware among others.</p>

<p class="indent">The sign of the Delaware passive is the suffix <i>gussu</i>
or <i>cusso</i>. In the Cree dialect, which, as I have already said,
preserves the ancient forms most closely, this is <i>k-ussu</i>,
and is a particle expressing likeness or similarity in animate
objects<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a>.
Hence, probably, the original sense of the Lenape word translated,
"I am loved," is "I am like the object of the action of loving."

<h2>CHAPTER V.</h2>
<p class="f120"><b><span class="smcap">Historical Sketches of the Lenape.</span></b></p>

<p class="blockquot space-above1">
§ 1. The Lenape as "Women"<br />
§ 2. Recent Migrations of the Lenape<br />
§ 3. Missionary Efforts in the Provinces of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.</p>

<h3>§ 1. <i>The Lenape as "Women".</i></h3>

<p class="indent">A unique peculiarity of the political condition
of the Lenape was that for a certain time they occupied a recognized
position as non-combatants&mdash;as "women," as they
were called by the Iroquois.</p>

<p class="indent">Indian customs and phraseology attached a
two-fold significance to this term.</p>

<p class="indent">The more honorable was that of peace-makers.
Among the Five Nations and Susquehannocks, certain grave matrons
of the tribe had the right to sit in the councils, and, among
other privileges, had that of proposing a cessation of hostilities
in time of war. A proposition from them to drop the
war club could be entertained without compromising the
reputation of the tribe for bravery. There was an official
orator and messenger, whose appointed duty it was to convey
such a pacific message from the matrons, and to negotiate
for peace<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Another and less honorable sense of the term arose
from a custom prevalent throughout America, and known also among
the ancient Scythians. Its precise purpose remains obscure,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
although it has been made the subject of a careful study by
one of our most eminent surgeons, who had facilities of
observation among the Western tribes<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a>.
Certain young men of the tribe, apparently vigorous and of normal
development, were deprived of the accoutrements of the male sex,
clothed like women, and assigned women's work to do. They neither
went out to hunt nor on the war-path, and were treated as
inferiors by their male associates. Whether this degradation
arose from superstitious rites or sodomitic practices, it certainly
carried to its victims the contempt of both sexes.</p>

<p class="indent">In their account of the transaction the Delawares
claimed that they were appointed as peace-makers in an honorable
manner, although the Iroquois deceived them as to their object.</p>

<p class="indent">The Lenape account is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"The Iroquois sent messengers to the Delawares
with the following speech:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"'It is not well that all nations should war;
for that will finally bring about the destruction of the Indians. We have
thought of a means to prevent this before it is too late. Let
one nation be The Woman. We will place her in the middle,
and the war nations shall be the Men and dwell around the
Woman. No one shall harm the Woman; and if one does,
we shall speak to him and say, 'Why strikest thou the
Woman?' Then all the Men shall attack him who has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
struck the Woman. The Woman shall not go to war, but
shall do her best to keep the peace. When the Men around
her fight one another, and the strife waxes hot, the Woman
shall have power to say: 'Ye Men! what do ye that ye thus
strike one another? Remember that your wives and children
must perish, if ye do not cease. Will ye perish from the face
of the earth?' Then the Men shall listen to the Woman and obey her.'</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"The Delawares did not at once perceive the aim of the
Iroquois, and were pleased to take this position of the Woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"Then the Iroquois made a great feast, and invited the
Delawares, and spoke to their envoys an address in three parts.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"First, they declared the Delaware nation to be the Woman
in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"'We place upon you the long gown of a woman, and
adorn you with earrings.'</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"This was as much as to say that thenceforward they were
not to bear arms.</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"The second sentence was in these words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot indent">"'We hang on your arm a calabash of oil and
medicine. With the oil you shall cleanse the ears of other nations that
they listen to good and not to evil. The medicine you shall
use for those nations who have been foolish, that they may
return to their senses, and turn their hearts to peace.'</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"The third sentence intimated that the Delawares should
make agriculture their chief occupation. It was:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&emsp;"'We give herewith into your hands a corn pestle and a hoe.'
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-above2">"Each sentence was accompanied with a belt
of wampum. These belts have ever since been carefully preserved and their
meanings from time to time recalled."<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Opinions of historians about this tradition have
been various. It has generally been considered a fabrication of the
Delawares, to explain their subjection in a manner consoling
to their national vanity. Gen. Harrison dismisses it as
impossible;<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a>
Albert Gallatin says, "it is too incredible to
require serious discussion;"<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a>
Mr. Hale characterizes it as
"preposterous;"<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
and Bishop de Schweinitz as "fabulous
and absurd"<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">On the other hand, it is vouched for by Zeisberger,
who furnished the account to Loskiel, and who would not have
said that the wampum belts with their meaning were still preserved
unless he knew it to be a fact. It is repeated emphatically
by Heckewelder, who adds that his informants
were not only Delawares but Mohegans as well, who could not
have shared the motive suggested above<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">There can be no question but that the neutral position
of the Delawares was something different from that of a conquered
nation, and that it meant a great deal more. They
undoubtedly were the acknowledged peace-makers over a
wide area, and this in consequence of some formal ancient
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
treaty. This is distinctly stated by the Stockbridge Indian,
Hendrick Aupaumut, in his curious Narrative:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a></p>

<p class="indent">"The Delawares, who we called <i>Wenaumeen</i>, are
our Grandfathers, according to the ancient covenant of their and our
ancestors, to which we adhere without any deviation in these
near 200 years, to which nation the 5 nations and British have
commit the whole business. For this nation has the greatest
influence with the southern, western and northern nations."</p>

<p class="indent">Hence Aupaumut undertook his embassy directly
to them, so as to secure their influence for peace in 1791.</p>

<p class="indent">To the fact that they exerted this influence during
the Revolutionary War, may very plausibly be attributed the success
of the Federal cause in the dark days of 1777 and 1778;
for, as David Zeisberger wrote: "If the Delawares had taken
part against the Americans in the present war, America would
have had terrible experiences; for the neutrality of the Delawares
kept all the many nations that are their grandchildren
neutral also, except the Shawanese, who are no longer in
close union with their grandfathers."<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">When at the close of the French War, in 1758, the
treaty of Easton put a stop to the bloody feuds of the border, "the
<i>peace-belt</i> was sent to our brethren, the Delawares, that they
might send it to all the nations living toward the setting
sun,"<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a>
and they carried it as the recognized pacific envoys.</p>

<p class="indent">The Iroquois, however, assumed a most arrogant
and contemptuous tone toward the Delawares, about the middle of
the eighteenth century. In 1756 they sent a belt to them,
with a most insulting message:<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a>
"You will remember that
you are our women; our forefathers made you so, and put a
petticoat on you, and charged you to be true to us, and lie
with no other man; but now you have become a common
bawd," etc.</p>

<p class="indent">Two years later, the Cayuga chief, John Hudson, said, at
a council at Burlington,<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a>
"The Munseys are women, and cannot make treaties for themselves."</p>

<p class="indent">These were but repetitions of the famous diatribe
of the Onondaga chieftain, Canassatego, at a council at Philadelphia,
in 1742. Turning to the representatives of the Lenape,
he broke out upon them with the words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"How came you to take upon you to sell land?
We conquered you. We made women of you. You know you are
women, and can no more sell land than women. * * *
We charge you to remove instantly. We don't give you the
liberty to think about it. We assign you two places to go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
to, either Wyoming or Shamokin. Don't deliberate, but
remove away; and take this belt of wampum."</p>

<p class="indent">And as he handed the belt to the Lenape head chief
he seized him by his long hair and pushed him out of the door
of the council room!</p>

<p class="indent">It was notorious at the time, however, that this
was a scene arranged between the Governor of the Province, Mr. George
Thomas, and the Iroquois deputation. The Lenape had been
grossly cheated out of their lands by the trick of the so-called
"Long Walk," in 1735, and they refused to vacate their
hunting grounds. The Governor sent secret messengers to
the powerful and dreaded Six Nations to exert their pretended
rights, and paid them well for it.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>

<p class="indent">What could the Lenape do? They were feeble, and
undoubtedly had been brought under the authority of their
warlike northern neighbors. They found themselves in the
position of the Persian chieftain Harmosar, as he stood before
the caliph Omar, and heard the latter revile the patriot cause:</p>

<p class="space-above2 space-below1"><span class="m-left_5">
"In deinen Händen ist die Macht,</span><br />
<span class="m-left_5">Wer einem Sieger widerspricht, der widerspricht mit Unbedacht."</span><br />
<span class="m-left_20">&mdash;<i>Van Platen-Hallermunde</i>.</span></p>

<p class="indent">Such were the respective claims of the Lenape and
Iroquois. Instead of discussing the antecedent probability of one or
the other being true, I shall endeavor to ascertain from the early
records the precise facts about this curious transaction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
It is certain that toward the close of the sixteenth century
the unending wars between the Delaware confederacy and the
Iroquois had reduced the latter almost to destruction. The
Jesuit missionaries tell us this.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a>
The turning point in their
affairs was the settlement of the Dutch on the Hudson.
Quick to appreciate the value of firearms, they bought guns
and powder at any price, and soon had rendered themselves
formidable to all their neighbors.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
About 1670 they attacked successfully that family of the
Minsi called the <i>Minisink</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">This was probably the victory to which the Five
Nations referred at a treaty at Philadelphia, in 1727, when they
stated that their conquest of the Delawares was about the time
William Penn first landed, and that he sent congratulations
to them on their success&mdash;an obvious falsehood.<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a></p>

<p class="indent">They were certainly at that period pressing hard
on the Susquehannocks and destroying their remnant in the valley
of that river. Mr. William P. Foulke is quite correct in his
conclusion that, "Upon the whole we may conclude that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Lancaster lands fell into the power of the Five Nations at
some time between 1677 and 1684."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Yet their conquest of the Minsi was not complete.
The latter had the mind and the will to renew the combat. In
1692 they appealed to the government of Pennsylvania to aid
them in an attack on the Senecas, but the Quakers declined
the foray. The next year the Minsi asked Governor Benjamin
Fletcher at least to protect them against these Senecas, adding
that with assistance they were ready to attack them, for
"although wee are a small number of Indians, wee are Men,
and know fighting."<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Evidently there was neither subjection nor
womanhood with the Minsi at that date.</p>

<p class="indent">There is also positive evidence that the Five
Nations at that time regarded the Delawares as a combatant nation,
and worthy of an invitation to join a war. On July 6th, 1694,
Governor Wm. Markham met in conference the famous chief
Tamany and others; and the Delaware orator, Hithquoquean,
laid down a belt of wampum, and said:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">"This belt is sent us by the Onondagas
and Senecas, who say: 'You Delaware Indians do nothing but stay at
home and boil your pots, and are like women; while we, Onondagas
and Senecas, go abroad and fight the enemy.'"<br /><br />
"The Senecas would have us Delaware Indians to be partners
with them, and fight against the French, but we, having
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
always been a peaceful people, and resolving to live so; and
being but weak and verie few in number, cannot assist them,
and having resolved among ourselves not to go, doe intend
to send back, this their Belt of Wampum."</p>

<p class="indent">The Lenape, therefore, did not, at that date,
occupy any degrading position, although they were under the
general domination of the Iroquois League.</p>

<p class="indent">Both these points are proved yet more conclusively
by the proceedings at a conference at White Marsh, May 19th, 1712,
between Governor C. Gookin and the Delaware chiefs.
Gollitchy, orator of the latter, exhibited thirty-two belts of
wampum, which they were on their way to deliver to the
Five Nations, adding "that many years ago they had been
made tributaries to the Mingoes." He also shewed "a long
Indian pipe, with a stone head, a wooden shaft, and feathers
fixt to it like wings. This pipe, they said, upon making
their submission to the Five Nations, who had subdued
them, and obliged them to be their tributaries, those Nations
had given to these Indians, to be kept by them." All the
tribute belts, however, were sent by the women and children,
as the speaker explained at length, "as the Indian
reckons the paying of tribute becomes none but women and
children."<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately, however, we are able to fix the
exact date and circumstances of the political transformation of
the Delawares into women. It is by no means so remote as
Mr. Heckewelder thought, who located the occurrence at
Norman's Kill, on the Hudson, between 1609 and 1620;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
and it was long after 1670, which is the date assigned by
Mr. Ruttenber,<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>
from a study of the New York records.</p>

<p class="indent">It was in the year 1725, and was in consequence
of the Delawares refusing to join the Iroquois in an attack on the
English settlements.</p>

<p class="indent">These data come to light in a message of the
Shawnee chiefs, in 1732, to Governor Gordon, who had inquired
their reasons for migrating to the Ohio Valley.</p>

<p class="indent">Their reply was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent blockquot">"About nine years agoe the 5 nations told
us att Shallyschohking, wee Did nott Do well to Setle there, for there
was a Greatt noise In the Greatt house and thatt in three years time,
all Should know whatt they had to Say, as far as there was any
Setlements or the Sun Sett."
<br /><br />
"About ye Expiration of 3 years affore S<sup>d</sup>, the 5 nations Came
and Said our Land is goeing to bee taken from us, Come brothers
assistt us Lett us fall upon and fightt with the English. Wee
answered them no, wee Came here for peace and have Leave to
Setle here, and wee are In League with them and Canott break itt."
<br /><br />
"Aboutt a year after they, ye 5 nations, Told the Delawares
and us, Since you have nott hearkened to us, nor Regarded whatt
we have said, now wee will pettycoatts on you, and Look upon
you as women for the future, and nott as men. Therefore, you
Shawanese Look back toward Ohioh, The place from whence you
Came, and Return thitherward, for now wee Shall Take pitty on
the English and Lett them have all this Land."
<br /><br />
"And further Said now Since you are Become women, He
Take Peahohquelloman, and putt itt on Meheahoaming and He
Take Meheahoaming and putt itt on Ohioh, and Ohioh He putt
on Woabach, and thatt shall bee the warriours Road for the
future." (<i>Penna Archives</i>, Vol. I.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent space-above1">The circumstances attending the ceremony were
probably pretty much as Loskiel relates.</p>

<p class="indent">The correctness of this account is borne out
by an examination of law titles.</p>

<p class="indent">That the river tribes at the time of Penn's treaties
(1680-1700) could not sell their lands without the permission of the
Iroquois has never been established. Mr. Gallatin states that
William Penn "always purchased the right of possession from
the Delawares, and that of sovereignty from the Five Nations."<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
This may have been the case in some later treaties of the
colony, but certainly there is no intimation of it in the celebrated
"First Indian Deed" to Penn, July 15th, 1682.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a>
Furthermore, in the Release which the Iroquois did give of
their Pennsylvania lands in 1736, the boundaries are defined
as "Westward to the Setting of the Sun, and Eastward to the
furthest springs of the Waters running into the said River,"
<i>i. e.</i>, the Susquehannah;<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a>
and to do away with any doubt
that the tract thus defined included all the land in this part
to which they had a claim, the Release goes on to recite that
"our true intent and meaning was and is to release all our
Right, Claim and Pretensions whatsoever to all and every the
Lands lying within the Bounds and Limits of the Government
of Pennsylvania, Beginning Eastward on the River Delaware,
as far Northward as the s<sup>d</sup> Ridge or Chain of Endless Mountains."
In other words, although the Six Nations advanced
no claim to land east of the Susquehanna watershed, the
Proprietors chose to include the Delaware watershed so as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
avoid any future complication. It seems to me this Release
does away with any "right of sovereignty" of the Iroquois
over the Delaware Valley south of the mountains, and brands
Canassatego's remarks above quoted as braggart falsehoods.</p>

<p class="indent">As for land east of the Delaware river,
Mr. Ruttenber correctly observes: "The Iroquois never questioned
the sales made by the Lenapes or Minsis east of that river. * * The
findings of Gallatin in this particular are confirmed by all the
title deeds in New York and New Jersey."<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a></p>

<p class="indent">It was only to the Susquehannock lands, purchased by Penn
in 1699, that the confirmation of the Iroquois was required.<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The close of this condition of subjection was in
1756. In that year Sir William Johnson formally "took off the petticoat"
from the Lenape, and "handed them the war belt."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
The year subsequent they made the public declaration that
"they would not acknowledge but the Senecas as their superiors."<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Even their supremacy was soon rejected. At the
Treaty of Fort Pitt, October, 1778, Captain White Eyes, when reminded
by the Senecas that the petticoats were still on his people,
scornfully repudiated the imputation, and made good his
words by leading a war party against them the following year.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The Iroquois, however, released their hold unwillingly,
and it was not until 1794, shortly before the Treaty of Greenville,
that their delegates came forward and "officially declared
that the Lenape were no longer women, but <i>men</i>," and the
famous chief, Joseph Brant, placed in their hands the war
club.<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a></p>

<h3>§ 2. <i>Historic Migrations of the Lenape</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">It does not form part of my plan to detail the later
history of the Lenape. But some account of their number and migrations
will aid in the examination of the origin and claims
of the <span class="smcap">Walum Olum</span>.</p>

<p class="indent">The first estimate of the whole number of native
inhabitants of the province was by William Penn. He stated that there
were ten different nations, with a total population of about
6000 souls.<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This was in 1683. Very soon after this they began
to diminish by disease and migration. As early as 1690, a band
of the Minsi left for the far West, to unite with the Ottawas.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
In 1721 the Frenchman Durant speaks of them as "exceedingly
decreased."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
Already they had yielded to the pressure
of the whites, and were seeking homes on the head-waters of
the Ohio, in Western Pennsylvania. Their first cabins are
said to have been built there in 1724.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">All that remained in the Delaware valley were
ordered by the Iroquois, at the treaty of Lancaster, 1744, to leave
the waters of their river, and remove to Shamokin (now Sunbury)
and Wyoming, on the Susquehanna, and most of them obeyed. The former
was their chief town, and the residence of their "king," Allemœbi.</p>

<p class="indent">When the interpreter, Conrad Weiser, visited their
Ohio settlements, in 1748, he reported their warriors there at 165,
which was probably about one-fourth of the nation.</p>

<p class="indent">In the "French War," 1755, the Delawares united
with the French against the Iroquois and English, and suffered
considerable losses. At its close they were estimated to
have, both on the Susquehanna and in Ohio, a total of 600
available fighting men.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a></p>

<p class="indent">After this date they steadily migrated from the
Susquehannah to the streams in central and eastern Ohio,
establishing their chief fire on the Tuscarawas river, at
Gekelemukpechunk, and hunting on the Muskingum, the
Licking, etc.<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When the war of the Revolution broke out, Zeisberger
used all his efforts to have them remain neutral, and at least
prevented them from joining in a general attack on the settlements.
Their distinguished war-chief, Koquethagachton,
known to the settlers as "Captain White Eyes," declared,
in 1775, in favor of the Federal cause, and renounced for
himself and his people all dependence on the Iroquois.
These friendly relations were confirmed at the treaty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
Fort Pitt (1778), and the next year a number of Delawares
accompanied Col. Brodhead in an expedition against the Senecas.</p>

<p class="indent">The massacre of the unoffending Christian natives
of Gnadenhütten, in 1788, was but one event in the murderous
war between the races that continued in Ohio from 1782 to
the treaty of peace at Greenville, in 1795.</p>

<p class="indent">To escape its direful scenes, a part of the Delawares
removed south, to upper Louisiana, in 1789, where they received
official permission from Governor Carondelet, in 1793, to
locate permanent homes.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Zeisberger also, in 1791, conducted
his colony of Christian Indians to Canada, and founded the
town of Fairfield, on the Retrenche river. Thus, in both
directions the Delawares were driven off the soil of the
United States. Yet those that remained in Ohio, if we
may accept the account of John Brickell, who was a captive
among them from 1791 to 1796, attempted to live a peaceable
and agricultural life.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Peace restored, the Delawares made their next remove
to the valley of White Water river, Indiana, where they attempted
to rekindle the national council fire, under the head chief
Tedpachxit. They founded six towns, the largest of which
was <i>Woapikamikunk</i> or <i>Wapeminskink</i>, "Place of Chestnut
Trees." This tract was guaranteed them "in perpetuity"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
by the treaty of Vincennes, 1808.<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
Nevertheless, just ten years later, at the treaty of St. Mary's,
they released the whole of their land, "without reserve," to the
United States, the government agreeing to remove them west of
the Mississippi, and grant them land there.</p>

<p class="indent">At this time they numbered about 1000 souls, of whom
800 were Delawares, the others being Mohegans and Nanticokes.<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a>
Their head chief was Thahutoowelent, of the Turkey tribe,
Tedpachxit having been assassinated, at the instigation of Tecumseh.</p>

<p class="indent">They are described as "having a peculiar aversion
to white people," and "more opposed to the Gospel and the whites
than any other Indians,"<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a>
which is small matter of wonder,
when they had seen the peaceful Christian converts of their
nation massacred three times, in cold blood, once at Gnadenhütten,
in Pennsylvania (1756); again at Gnadenhütten,
in Ohio (1788), and finally at Fairfield, Canada (1813).</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Isaac McCoy, who visited them on the
White Water, in the winter of 1818-19, states that they lived in
log huts and bark shanties, and were fearfully deteriorated
by whisky drinking.<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The last band of the Delawares that appeared in Ohio was
in 1822.<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The location assigned to the Delawares was near
the mouth of the Kansas river, Kansas. They were reported, in 1850,
as possessing there 375,000 acres and numbering about 1500
souls. Four years later they "ceded" this land, and were
moved to various reservations in the Indian Territory.</p>

<p class="indent">There still remain about sixty natives at New
Westfield, near Ottawa, Kansas, under the charge of the Moravian
Church. The same denomination has about 300 of the tribe
on the reservation at Moraviantown, in the province of
Ontario, Canada. A second reservation in Canada is under
the charge of the Anglican Church. The majority of the tribe
are scattered in different agencies in the Indian Territory.</p>

<h3>§ 3. <i>Missionary Efforts in the Provinces of New Jersey and Pennsylvania</i>.</h3>

<p class="indent">None of the American colonies enjoyed a more
favorable opportunity to introduce the Christian religion to the
natives than that located on the Delaware river. What use was
made of it?</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Thomas Campanius, of Stockholm, a
Lutheran clergyman, attached to the Swedish settlement from 1642 to
1649, made a creditable effort to acquire the native tongue and
preach Christianity to the savages about him. He translated
the Catechism into the traders' dialect of Lenape, but we have
no record that he succeeded in his attempts at conversion.</p>

<p class="indent">One might suppose that so very religious a body
as the early Friends would have taken some positive steps in this
direction. Such was not the case. I have not found the record
of any one of them who set seriously to work to learn the native
tongue, without which all effort would have been fruitless.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">William Penn was not wholly unmindful of the spiritual
condition of his native wards. In 1699 he offered to provide
the Friends' Meeting at Philadelphia with interpreters to convey
religious instruction to the Indians. But the Meeting
took no steps in this direction. He himself, when in the
colony in 1701, made some attempts to address them on religious
subjects, as did also Friend John Richardson, who was
with him, availing themselves of interpreters. The latter
reports a satisfactory response to his words, but not being
followed up, their effect was ephemeral.<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Nothing further was done for nearly half a century,
and when the enthusiastic young David Brainerd began his mission
in 1742, he distinctly states that there was not another missionary
in either province.<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a>
His labors extended over four
years, and were productive of some permanent good results
among the New Jersey Indians, and this in spite of the suspicions,
opposition and evil example of the whites around
him. The little society of Christian Indians which he gathered
in Burlington County, New Jersey, was even reported as a
congregation of rioters and enemies of the State!<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Nor was the province of Penn inclined to greater
favors toward Christianized natives. When the Indians were cheated
out of their lands by the "Long Walk," a few who had been
converted, among others the chief Moses Tatemy, petitioned
the Council to remain on their lands, some of which were direct
personal gifts from the Proprietaries. Their request was refused,
and Moses Tatemy, who did remain, was shot down like a dog, in the
road, by a white man.<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Unknown to Brainerd, however, the seeds of a Christian
harvest had already been sown, in 1742, in the wilderness of Pennsylvania,
by the ardent Moravian leader, Count Nicholas Lewis Zinzendorf; already,
in 1744, the fervent Zeisberger, prescient of his long and marvelous
service in the church militant, had registered himself as
<i>destinirter Heidenbote</i>&mdash;"appointed messenger to the heathen"&mdash;in
the corner-stone of the Brethren's House, at Bethlehem; already the
pious Rauch had collected a small but earnest congregation of
Mohegans at Shekomeko, who soon removed to the Lehigh
valley, and pitched the first of those five <i>Gnadenhütten</i>,
"Tents of Grace," destined successively to mark the unwearied
efforts of the Moravian missionaries, and their frustration
through the treachery of the conquering whites.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">It is not my purpose to tell the story of this long
struggle. Its thrilling events are recounted, with all desirable
fullness, in the vivid narrative of Bishop Edmund de Schweinitz,
grouped around the marked individuality of the devoted
Zeisberger&mdash;pages which none can read without amazement
at the undaunted courage of these Christian heroes, without
sorrow at the sparse harvest gleaned from such devotion.<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a></p>

<p class="indent">When, after sixty-two years of missionary labors,
the venerable Zeisberger closed his eyes in death (1808), the huts
of barely a score of converted Indians clustered around his little
chapel. His aspiration that the Lenape would form a native
Christian State, their ancient supremacy revived and applied
to the dissemination of peace, piety and civilization among
their fellow-tribes&mdash;this cherished hope of his life had forever
disappeared. He had lived to see the Lenape, a mere broken
remnant, "steeped in all the abominations of heathenism,
eke out their existence far away from their former council fires."

<h3><i>Cosmogonical and Culture Myths.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The Algonkins, as a stock, had a well developed
creation-myth and a culture legend, found in more or less
completeness in all their branches.</p>

<p class="indent">Their culture hero, their ancestor and creator,
he who made the earth and stocked it with animals, who taught them
the arts of war and the chase, and gave them the Indian corn,
beans and squashes, was generally called <i>Michabo</i>, The Great
Light, but was also known among the Narragansetts of New
England as <i>Wetucks</i>, The Common Father; among the Cree
as <i>Wisakketjâk</i>, the Trickster; by the Chippeways as Nanabozho
(<i>Nenâboj</i>), the Cheat; by the Black Feet as <i>Natose</i>,
Our Father, or <i>Napiw</i>; and by the Micmacs and Penobscots
as <i>Glus-Kap</i>, the Liar.</p>

<p class="indent">I have given the details of this myth and analyzed them
in previous works;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
here it is sufficient to say that it is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
Light-myth, and one of noble proportion and circumstance,
quite worthy of comparison with those of the Oriental world.</p>

<p class="indent">Traces of it are reported among the Lenape, and
I doubt not that had we their ancient stories in their completeness,
we should find that they had preserved it as wholly as the
Chipeways. These related of their Nanabozho that he was
the son of a maiden who had descended from heaven. She
conceived without knowledge of man, and having given birth
to twins, she disappeared. One of these twins was Nanabozho.
Having formed the earth by his miraculous powers, and done
many wonderful things, he disappeared toward the east, where
he still dwells beyond the sunrise.</p>

<p class="indent">It was undoubtedly a fragment of this legend
that the Swedish engineer, Lindstrom heard among the Lenape, on
the Delaware, about 1650. They told him, or rather he
understood them, as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Once, one of your women (<i>i.e.</i>, a
white woman) came among us, and she became pregnant, in consequence
of drinking out of a creek; an Indian had connection with her,
and she became pregnant, and brought forth a son, who,
when he came to a certain size, was so sensible and clever,
that there never was one who could be compared to him, so
much and so well he spoke, which excited great wonder; he
also performed many miracles. When he was quite grown
up, he left us, and went up to heaven, and promised to come
again, but has never returned."<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This is but a mistranslation of the general Algonkin
legend, in which the virgin mother bears a white and dark twin,
the former of whom becomes the tribal culture hero and demiurgic deity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Its interpretation is, that the virgin is the Dawn,
who brings forth the Day, which assures safety and knowledge, and the
Night, which departs with her. The Day leaves us, and in its
personified form returns no more, though ever expected.</p>

<p class="indent">That such were the original form and significance of the
myth, we have the testimony of Bishop Ettwein,<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a>
himself a Delaware scholar, and who drew his information from the
natives as well as the missionaries. He tells us that their
legend ran, that in the beginning the first woman fell from
heaven and bore twins; that it was toward the east that they
directed their children to turn their faces when they prayed
to the spirits; and that their old men had said that it was an
ancient belief that from that quarter some one would come
to them to benefit them. Therefore, said they, when our
ancestors saw the first white men, they looked upon them as
divine, and adored them.</p>

<p class="indent">The Dutch travelers, Jasper Donkers and Peter
Sluyter, relate a part of this myth as they heard it from New Jersey
Indians in 1679. These informed them that all things came
from a tortoise. It had brought forth the world, and from
the middle of its back had sprung up a tree, upon whose
branches men had grown.</p>

<p class="indent">This tortoise "had a power and a nature to produce
all things, such as earth, trees and the like." But it was not
the <i>primum mobile</i>, not the ultimate energy of the universe.
"The first and great beginning of all things was <i>Kickeron</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
or <i>Kickerom</i>, who is the original of all, who has not only
once produced or made all things, but produces every day."
The tortoise brought forth what this primal divinity "wished
through it to produce."<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This is a very interesting statement. It reveals
a depth of thought on the part of the native philosophers for which we
were scarcely prepared. The worthy Dutch travelers do not pretend
to explain the myth. But its sense can be clearly interpreted.</p>

<p class="indent">The turtle or tortoise is everywhere in Algonkin pictography
the symbol of the earth.<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
From the earth, from the soil, all organic life, the whole realm of animate
existence&mdash;ever sharply defined in Algonkin grammar and thought from
inanimate existence&mdash;proceeds, directly as vegetable life, or
indirectly as animal life. The earth is the All-Mother, ever-producing, inexhaustible.</p>

<p class="indent">As for <i>Kikeron</i>, the eternally active, hidden
spirit of the universe, I have but to refer the reader to the list of
ideas associated around this root <i>kik</i>, which I have given on a
previous page (<a href="#Page_102">p. 102</a>) to reveal the significance of
this word. We may, with equal correctness, translate it Life, Light,
Action or Energy. It is the abstract conception back of all these.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">The distinction was the same as that established by
the scholastic philosophers between the <i>mundus</i> and the <i>anima
mundi</i>; between the <i>essentia</i> and the <i>existentia;</i>
between <i>natura naturans</i> and <i>natura naturata</i>. But who
expected to find it among the Lenape?</p>

<p class="indent">This creation myth of the Delawares is also given
in brief by Zeisberger. It dated back to that marvelous overflow
which is heard of in many mythologies. The whole earth
was submerged, and but a few persons survived. They had
taken refuge on the back of a turtle, who had reached so
great an age that his shell was mossy, like the bank of a
rivulet. In this forlorn condition a loon flew that way, which
they asked to dive and bring up land. He complied, but
found no bottom. Then he flew far away, and returned with
a small quantity of earth in his bill. Guided by him, the
turtle swam to the place, where a spot of dry land was found.
There the survivors settled and repeopled the land.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This is more a tale of reconstruction than a creation
myth. It is that which has generally been supposed to refer to the
Deluge. But, as I have explained in my "Myths of the New
World," all these so-called Deluge Myths are but developments
of crude cosmogonical theories.</p>

<p class="indent">To understand the significance of this myth
we must examine the Indian notion of the earth. This is the more
germane to my theme, as the meaning of the original text
which is printed in this volume can only be grasped by one
acquainted with this notion.</p>

<p class="indent">The Indians almost universally believed the dry
land they knew to be a part of a great island, everywhere surrounded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
by wide waters whose limits were unknown.<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a>
Many tribes had vague myths of a journey from beyond this sea;
many placed beyond it the home of the Sun and of Light, and the
happy hunting grounds of the departed souls. The Delawares
believed that the whole was supported by a fabled turtle, whose
movements caused earthquakes and who had been their first
preserver.<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a>
As above mentioned, the turtle in its amphibious
character and rounded back represented the earth or the land
itself, as distinguished from water. Like the turtle, the land
lies at times under the water and at times above it. The
spirit of the earth was the practical and visible developmental
energy of nature.</p>

<p class="indent">The medicine men, or conjurers, who professed
to be in personal relations with this power, made their "medicine
rattle" of a turtle shell (Loskiel), and when they died,
such a shell was suspended from their tomb posts (Zeisberger).</p>

<p class="indent">The Delawares also shared the belief, common to so many
nations the world over, that the pristine age was one of unalloyed
prosperity, peace and happiness, an Age of Gold, a
Saturnian Reign. Their legends asseverated that at that time
"the killing of a man was unknown, neither had there been
instances of their dying before they had attained to that age
which causes the hair to become white, the eyes dim, and the
teeth to be worn away."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">This happy time was brought to a close by the advent
of certain evil beings who taught men how to kill each other by
sorcery.<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Their kinsmen, the Mohegans, varied this cosmogonical
tradition, though retaining some of its main features. They
taught that in the beginning there was nought but water and
sky. At length from the sky a woman descended, our common
mother. As she approached the boundless ocean, a small
point of land rose above the watery surface, and supplied her
with firm footing. She was pregnant by some mysterious
power, and she brought forth on this island animal triplets&mdash;
a bear, a deer and a wolf. From these all men and animals
are descended. The island grew to a main land, and the
mother of all, her mission accomplished, returned to her
home in the sky.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p class="indent">This creation-myth, obtained from the Indians around
New York harbor in the first generation after the advent of the
whites, has every mark of a genuine native production, and
coincides closely with that generally believed by the early Algonkins.</p>

<p class="indent">It is followed by a migration myth, which ran to the
effect that their early forefathers came out of the northwest, forsaking
a tide-water country, and crossing over a great watery
tract, called <i>ukhkok-pek</i>, "snake water, or water where snakes
are abundant," (<i>âkhgook</i>, snake, and <i>pek</i>, standing water,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
probably from <i>n'pey</i>, water, <i>akek</i>, place or country).
They crossed many streams, but none in which the water ebbed
and flowed, until they reached the Hudson. "Then they
said, one to another, 'This is like the Muhheakunnuck
(tidal ocean) of our nativity.' Therefore they agreed to
kindle a fire there and hang a kettle, whereof they and their
children after them might dip out their daily refreshment."
Hence came their name, the Tide-water People (<a href="#Page_20">see ante, p. 20</a>).</p>

<h3><i>National Traditions.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">Many early writers attest the passionate fondness
of the Delawares for their ancestral traditions and the memory of
their ancient heroes. The missionary, David Brainerd, mentions
this as one of the leading difficulties in the way of
"evangelizing the Indians." "They are likewise much
attached," he writes, "to the traditions and fabulous notions
of their fathers, which they firmly believe, and thence look
upon their ancestors to have been the best of men."<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a></p>

<p class="indent">To the same effect, Loskiel informs us that the
Delawares "love to relate what great warriors their ancestors had been,
and how many heroic deeds they had performed. It is a
pleasure to them to rehearse their genealogies. They are so
skilled at it that they can repeat the chief and collateral
lines with the utmost readiness. At the same time, they
characterize their ancestors, by describing this one as a
wise or skillful man, as a great chieftain, a renowned warrior,
a rich man, and the like. This they teach to their children,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
and <i>embody it in pictures, so as to make it more readily
remembered."</i><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The earliest writer who gives us any detailed
description of what these traditions were, is the Rev. Charles Beatty,
who visited the Delaware settlements in Ohio in 1767. On
his way there, he met a white man, Benjamin Button, who
for years had been a captive among the natives. He related
to Beatty the following tradition, which he had heard recited
by some old men among the Delawares:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"That of old time their people were divided by a
river, nine parts of ten passing over the river, and one part
remaining behind; that they knew not, for certainty, how they
came to this continent; but account thus for their first coming
into these parts where they are now settled; that a king of
their nation, where they formerly lived, far to the west,
left his kingdom to his two sons; that the one son making
war upon the other, the latter thereupon determined to depart
and seek some new habitation; that accordingly he sat out,
accompanied by a number of his people, and that, after
wandering to and fro for the space of forty years, they at
length came to Delaware river, where they settled 370 years
ago. The way, he says, they keep an account of this is by
putting on a black bead of wampum every year on a belt
they keep for that purpose."<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">From another source Mr. Beatty obtained the traditions
of the Nanticokes, which is apparently a version of that of
their relatives, the Delawares. It ran to this effect: At some
remote age, while on their way to their present homes, "They
came to a great water. One of the Indians that went before
them tried the depth of it by a long pole or reed, which he
had in his hand, and found it too deep for them to wade.
Upon their being non-plussed, and not knowing how to get
over it, their God made a bridge over the water in one night,
and the next morning, after they were all over, God took
away the bridge."<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

<p class="indent">A curious addition to this story is mentioned
by Loskiel.<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a>
The number of the mythical ancestors of their race who thus
were left on the shore of the great water was <i>seven</i>. This at
once recalls the seven caves (<i>Chicomoztoc</i>) or primitive stirpes
of the Mexican tribes, the seven clans (<i>vuk amag</i>) of the
Cakchiquels, the seven ancestors of the Qquechuas, etc., and
strongly intimates that there must be some common natural
occurrence to give rise to this widespread legend.<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Some peculiar sacredness must have attached to this
number among the Delawares also, as we are informed that the period
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
of isolation of their women at the catamenial period was seven days.<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The lunar month of 28 days, if divided and assigned
equally to each of the four cardinal points, would give a week of seven
days to each. Something of this kind seems to have been
done by another Algonkin tribe, the Ottawas, who declared
that the winds are caused (alternately?) by seven genii or
gods who dwelt in the air.<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The seven day period is also a natural, physical one,
whose influence is felt widely by vertebrate and invertebrate animals,
as Darwin has pointed out,<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
and hence its appearance among these people, who lived entirely subject
to the operation of their physical surroundings, is not so surprising.</p>

<p class="indent">The most complete account of the Delaware tradition
is that preserved by Heckewelder. In his pages it appears, not
as a reminiscence of tribal history, but as the tradition of the
whole eastern Algonkin race, and it claims for the three Delaware
tribes an antiquity of organization surpassing that of any
of their neighbors.</p>

<p class="indent">It holds such an important place that I quote
all the essential passages:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p  class="indent">"The Lenni Lenape (according to the traditions
handed down to them by their ancestors) resided many hundred years
ago in a very distant country in the western part of the
American continent. For some reason, which I do not find
accounted for, they determined on migrating to the eastward,
and accordingly set out together in a body. After a very
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
long journey, and many nights' encampments by the way,
they at length arrived on the <i>Namoesi Sipu</i>, where they fell
in with the Mengwe, who had likewise emigrated from a distant
country, and had struck upon this river somewhat higher
up. Their object was the same with that of the Delawares;
they were proceeding on to the eastward, until they should
find a country that pleased them. The spies which the Lenape
had sent forward for the purpose of reconnoitring, had long
before their arrival discovered that the country east of the
Mississippi was inhabited by a very powerful nation, who had
many large towns built on the great rivers flowing through
their land. Those people (as I was told) called themselves
Talligeu or Talligewi. Colonel John Gibson, however, a
gentleman who has a thorough knowledge of the Indians,
and speaks several of their languages, is of opinion that they
were not called Talligewi, but Alligewi. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"Many wonderful things are told of this famous people.
They are said to have been remarkably tall, and stout, and
there is a tradition that there were giants among them, people
of a much larger size than the tallest of the Lenape. It is
related that they had built to themselves regular fortifications
or entrenchments, from whence they would sally out, but
were generally repulsed. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"When the Lenape arrived on the banks of the Mississippi,
they sent a message to the Alligewi to request permission to
settle themselves in their neighbourhood. This was refused
them, but they obtained leave to pass through the country
and seek a settlement farther to the eastward. They accordingly
began to cross the Namaesi Sipu, when the Alligewi,
seeing that their numbers were so very great, and in fact they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
consisted of many thousands, made a furious attack on those
who had crossed, threatening them all with destruction, if
they dared to persist in coming over to their side of the
river. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"Having united their forces, the Lenape and Mengwe
declared war against the Alligewi, and great battles were fought,
in which many warriors fell on both sides. The enemy fortified
their large towns and erected fortifications, especially on
large rivers and near lakes, where they were successively attacked
and sometimes stormed by the allies. An engagement
took place in which hundreds fell, who were afterwards buried
in holes or laid together in heaps and covered over with earth.
No quarter was given, so that the Alligewi, at last, finding
that their destruction was inevitable if they persisted in their
obstinacy, abandoned the country to the conquerors, and
fled down the Mississippi river, from whence they never
returned. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"In the end the conquerors divided the country
between themselves; the Mengwe made choice of the lands in the
vicinity of the great lakes and on their tributary streams, and
the Lenape took possession of the country to the south. For
a long period of time&mdash;some say many hundred years&mdash;the
two nations resided peaceably in this country, and increased
very fast; some of their most enterprising huntsmen and
warriors crossed the great swamps, and falling on streams
running to the eastward, followed them down to the great
Bay river, thence into the Bay itself, which we call Chesapeak.
As they pursued their travels, partly by land and
partly by water, sometimes near and at other times on the
great Salt-water Lake, as they call the sea, they discovered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
the great river, which we call the Delaware; and thence
exploring still eastward, the <i>Scheyichbi</i> country, now named
New Jersey, they arrived at another great stream, that which
we call the Hudson or North river. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"At last they settled on the four great rivers
(which we call Delaware, Hudson, Susquehannah, Potomack), making
the Delaware, to which they gave the name of <i>'Lenape-wihittuck'</i>
(the river or stream of the Lenape), the centre of their possessions.</p>

<p class="indent">"They say, however, that the whole of their nation
did not reach this country; that many remained behind, in order
to aid and assist that great body of their people which had
not crossed the Namaesi Sipu, but had retreated into the
interior of the country on the other side. * * *</p>

<p class="indent">"Their nation finally became divided into three
separate bodies; the larger body, which they suppose to have been
one-half the whole, was settled on the Atlantic, and the other
half was again divided into two parts, one of which, the
strongest, as they suppose, remained beyond the Mississippi,
and the remainder where they left them, on this side of that river.</p>

<p class="indent">"Those of the Delawares who fixed their abodes on
the shores of the Atlantic divided themselves into three tribes.
Two of them, distinguished by the names of the <i>Turtle</i> and
the <i>Turkey</i>, the former calling themselves <i>Unâmi</i>, and the
other <i>Unalâchtgo</i>, chose those grounds to settle on which lay
nearest to the sea, between the coast and the high mountains.
As they multiplied, their settlements extended from the
<i>Mohicanittuck</i> (river of the Mohicans, which we call the
North or Hudson river) to the Potomack." * * *
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
"The third tribe, the <i>Wolf</i>, commonly called the <i>Minsi</i>,
which we have corrupted into <i>Monseys</i>, had chosen to live
back of the other two." * * * They extended their settlements
from the Minisink, a place named after them, where
they had their council seat and fire, quite up to the Hudson,
on the east; and to the west or southward far beyond the Susquehannah.</p>

<p class="indent">"From the above three tribes, the <i>Unami, Unalachtgo</i>
and the <i>Minsi</i>, had, in the course of time, sprung many others,
* * * the Mahicanni, or Mohicans, who spread themselves
over all that country which now composes the Eastern States,
* * * and the <i>Nanticokes</i>, who proceeded far to the south,
in Maryland and Virginia."</p></div>

<p class="indent">On their conquests during the period of their western
migrations, the Delawares based a claim for hunting grounds in
the Ohio valley. It is stated that when they had decided to
remove to the valley of the Muskingum, their chief, Netawatwes,
presented this claim to the Hurons and Miamis, and
had it allowed.<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
They also claimed lands on White River,
Indiana, and their settlement in that region at the close of
the last century was regarded as a return to their ancient seats.</p>

<p class="indent">Nevertheless, in the earliest historic times, when
the whites first came in contact with the Lenape tribes, none of them
dwelt west of the mountains, nor, apparently, had they any towns
in the valley of the west branch of the Susquehanna or of its main stream.</p>

<p class="indent">Although the above mentioned facts point to a migration
in prehistoric times from the West toward the East, there are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
indications of a yet older movement from the northeast westward
and southward to the upper Mississippi valley. A legend
common to the western Algonkin tribes, the Kikapoos, Sacs,
Foxes, Ottawas and Pottawatomies, located their original
home north of the St. Lawrence river, near or below where
Montreal now stands. In that distant land their ancestors
were created by the Great Spirit, and they dwelt there, "all
of one nation." Only when they removed or were driven
west did they separate into tribes speaking different dialects.<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The Shawnees, who at various times were in close
relation with the Delawares, also possessed a vague migration myth,
according to which, at some indefinitely remote past, they
had arrived at the main land after crossing a wide water.
Their ancestors succeeded in this by their great control of
magic arts, their occult power enabling them to walk over the
water as if it had been land. Until within the present century
this legend was repeated annually, and a yearly sacrifice offered
up in memory of their safe arrival.<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a>
It is evidently a version of that which appears in the
third part of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">One of the curious legends of the Lenape was that
of the Great Naked or Hairless Bear. It is told by the Rev. John
Heckewelder, in a letter to Dr. B. S. Barton.<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
The missionary had heard it both among the Delawares and the Mohicans.
By the former, it was spoken of as <i>amangachktiátmachque</i>,
and in the dialect of the latter, <i>ahamagachktiât mechqua</i>.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a></p>

<p class="indent">The story told of it was that it was immense in
size and the most ferocious of animals. Its skin was bare, except a
tuft of white hair on its back. It attacked and ate the natives,
and the only means of escape from it was to take to the water.
Its sense of smell was remarkably keen, but its sight was
defective. As its heart was very small, it could not be easily
killed. The surest plan was to break its back-bone; but so
dangerous was an encounter with it, that those hunters who
went in pursuit of it bade their families and friends farewell,
as if they never expected to return.</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately, there were few of these beasts. The
last one known was to the east, somewhere beyond the left bank of
the Mahicanni Sipu (the Hudson river). When its presence was
learned a number of bold hunters went there, and mounted a
rock with precipitous sides. They then made a noise, and
attracted the bear's attention, who rushed to the attack with
great fury. As he could not climb the rock, he tore at it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
with his teeth, while the hunters above shot him with arrows
and threw upon him great stones, and thus killed him.</p>

<p class="indent">Though this was the last of the species, the Indian
mothers still used his name to frighten their children into obedience,
threatening them with the words, "The Naked Bear will eat you."

<p class="indent">Constantine Samuel Rafinesque-Schmaltz, to whom we owe
the preservation and first translation of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>,
was born in Galata, a suburb of Constantinople, Oct. 22d,
1783, and died in Philadelphia, of cancer of the stomach,
Sept. 18th, 1840.</p>

<p class="indent">His first visit to this country was in 1802. He
remained until 1804, when he went to Sicily, where he commenced
business. As the French were unpopular there, he added
"Schmaltz" to his name, for "prudent considerations,"
that being the surname of his mother's family.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1815 he returned to America, but had the misfortune
to be shipwrecked on the coast, losing his manuscripts and much
of his property. On his arrival, he supported himself by
teaching, occupying his leisure time in scientific pursuits and
travel. In 1819 he was appointed "Professor of Historical
and Natural Sciences," in Transylvania University, Kentucky.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
This position he was obliged to resign, for technical reasons,
in 1826, when he returned to Philadelphia, which city he
made his home during the rest of his life.</p>

<p class="indent">From his early youth he was an indefatigable student,
collector and writer in various branches of knowledge, especially
in natural history. On the title-page of the last work that
he published, "The Good Book and Amenities of Nature"
(Philadelphia, 1840), he claims to be the author of "220 books,
pamphlets, essays and tracts." Including his contributions
to periodicals, there is no reason to doubt the correctness of
this estimate. They began when he was nineteen, and were
composed in English, French, Italian and Latin, all of which
he wrote with facility.</p>

<p class="indent">His earlier essays were principally on botanical
subjects; later, he included zoölogy and conchology; and during the
last fifteen years of his life the history and antiquities of
America appear to have occupied his most earnest attention.</p>

<p class="indent">The value of his writings in these various branches has
been canvassed by several eminent critics in their respective lines.</p>

<p class="indent">First in point of time was Prof. Asa Gray, who in
the year following Rafinesque's death published in the "American
Journal of Science and Arts," Vol. XI, an analysis of his
botanical writings. He awards him considerable credit for
his earlier investigations, but much less for his later ones. To
quote Dr. Gray's words: "A gradual deterioration will be
observed in Rafinesque's botanical writings from 1819 to 1830,
when the passion for establishing new genera and species appears
to have become a complete <i>monomania</i>."<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
But modern believers in the doctrine of the evolution of plant forms and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
the development of botanical species will incline to think
that there was a method in this madness, when they read the
passage from Rafinesque's writings, about 1836, which Dr.
Gray quotes as conclusively proving that, in things botanical,
Rafinesque had lost his wits. It is this: "But it is needless
to dispute about new genera, species and varieties. Every
variety is a deviation, which becomes a species as soon as it
is permanent by reproduction. Deviations in essential organs
may thus gradually become new genera." This is really an
anticipation of Darwinianism in botany.</p>

<p class="indent">The next year, in the same journal, appeared a
"Notice of the Zoölogical Writings of the late C. S. Rafinesque,"
by Prof. S. S. Haldeman. It is, on the whole, depreciatory, and
convicts Rafinesque of errors of observation as well as of inference;
at the same time, not denying his enthusiasm and
his occasional quickness to appreciate zoölogical facts.</p>

<p class="indent">In 1864 the conchological writings of Rafinesque
were collected and published, in Philadelphia, by A. G. Binney
and Geo. W. Tryon, Jr., without comments. One of
the editors informs me that they have positive merit,
although the author was too credulous and too desirous
of novelties.</p>

<p class="indent">The antiquarian productions of Rafinesque, which interest
us most in this connection, were reviewed with caustic severity
by Dr. S. F. Haven,<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a>
especially the "Ancient Annals of Kentucky",
which was printed as an introduction to Marshall's
History of that State, in 1824. It is, indeed, an
absurd production, a reconstruction of alleged history on the
flimsiest foundations; but, alas! not a whit more absurd than
the laborious card houses of many a subsequent antiquary of renown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">His principal work in this branch appeared in
Philadelphia in 1836, entitled: "The American Nations; or, Outlines
of a National History; of the Ancient and Modern Nations of
North and South America." It was printed for the author,
and is in two parts. Others were announced but never appeared,
nor did the maps and illustrations which the title
page promised. Its pages are filled with extravagant theories
and baseless analogies. In the first part he prints with notes
his translation of the <span class="smcap">The Walam Olum</span>,
and his explanation of its significance.</p>

<h3><i>History of the Walam Olum.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque's account of the origin of the
<span class="smcap">The Walam Olum</span>
may be introduced by a passage in the last work he published,
"The Good Book." In that erratic volume he tells us that
he had long been collecting the signs and pictographs current
among the North American Indians, and adds:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Of these I have now 60 used by the Southern or
Floridian Tribes of Louisiana to Florida, based upon their language
of Signs&mdash;40 used by the Osages and Arkanzas, based on the
same&mdash;74 used by the Lenàpian (Delaware and akin) tribes
in their <span class="smcap">The Walamolum</span> or Records&mdash;besides 30 simple
signs that can be traced out of the <span class="smcap">Neobagun</span> or Delineation
of the Chipwas or Ninniwas, a branch of the last."<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">In these lines Rafinesque makes an important statement,
which has been amply verified by the investigations of Col.
Garrick Mallery, Dr. W. J. Hoffman and Capt. W. P. Clark,
within the last decade, and that is, that the Indian pictographic
system was based on their gesture speech.</p>

<p class="indent">So far as I remember, he was the first to perceive
this suggestive fact; and he had announced it some time before 1840.
Already, in "The American Nations" (1836), he wrote,
"the Graphic Signs correspond to these Manual Signs."<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a></p>

<p class="indent">Here he anticipates a leading result of the latest
archaeological research; and I give his words the greater prominence,
because they seem to have been overlooked by all the recent
writers on Indian Gesture-speech and Sign-language.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Neobagun</i>, the Chipeway medicine song to
which he alludes, is likewise spoken of in "The American Nations,"
where he says: "The Ninniwas or Chipiwas * * have
such painted tales or annals, called Neobagun (male tool) by
the former."<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
I suspect he derived his knowledge of this
from the Shawnee "Song for Medicine Hunting," called
"Nah-o-bah-e-gun-num," or, The Four Sticks, the words and
figures of which were appended by Dr. James to Tanner's
<i>Narrative</i>, published in 1830.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>Discovery of the Walam Olum.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">As for the Lenape records, he gives this not
very clear account of his acquisition of them:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent blockquot">"Having obtained, through the late Dr. Ward,
of Indiana, some of the original Wallam-Olum (painted record) of the
Linàpi Tribe of Wapihani or White River, the translation
will be given of the songs annexed to each."<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p class="indent">On a later page he
wrote:&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">"<i>Olum</i> implies <i>a record, a notched stick</i>,
an engraved piece of wood or bark. It comes from <i>ol</i>, hollow or graved
record. * * * These actual <i>olum</i> were at first obtained
in 1820, as a reward for a medical cure, deemed a
curiosity; and were unexplicable. In 1822 were obtained
from another individual the songs annexed thereto in
the original language; but no one could be found by me
able to translate them. I had therefore to learn the
language since, by the help of Zeisberger, Heckewelder
and a manuscript dictionary, on purpose to translate
them, which I only accomplished in 1833. The contents
were totally unknown to me in 1824, when I published
my 'Annals of Kentucky.'"</p>

<p class="indent">I have attempted to identify this "Dr. Ward, of
Indiana;" but no such person is known in the early medical annals
of that State. There is, however, an old and well-known Kentucky
family of that name, who, about 1820, resided, and
still do reside, in the neighborhood of Cynthiana. One of
these, in 1824-25, was a friend of Rafinesque, invited him to
his house, and shared his archaeological tastes, as Rafinesque
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
mentions in his autobiography.<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a>
It was there, no doubt,
that he copied the signs and the original text of the Walam
Olum. My efforts to learn further about the originals from
living members of the family have been unsuccessful. From
a note in Rafinesque's handwriting, on the title page of his
MS. of 1833, it would appear that he had at least seen the
wooden tablets. This note reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"This Mpt &amp; the wooden original was (<i>sic</i>)
procured in 1822 in Kentucky&mdash;but was inexplicable till a deep
study of the Linapi enabled me to translate them with explanations.
(Dr. Ward.)"</p>

<p class="indent">The name of Dr. Ward added in brackets is, I judge,
merely a note, and is not intended to imply that the sentence is a quotation.</p>

<h3><i>Was it a Forgery?</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The crucial question arises: Was the
<span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span> a forgery by Rafinesque?</p>

<p class="indent">It is necessary to ask and to answer this question,
though it seems, at first sight, an insult to the memory of the man
to do so. No one has ever felt it requisite to propound such
an inquiry about the pieces of the celebrated Mexican collection
of the Chevalier Boturini, who, as an antiquary, was
scarcely less visionary than Rafinesque.</p>

<p class="indent">But, unquestionably, an air of distrust and doubt
shadowed Rafinesque's scientific reputation during his life, and he
was not admitted on a favorable footing to the learned circles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
the city where he spent the last fifteen years of his life. His
articles were declined a hearing in its societies; and the
learned linguist, Mr. Peter Stephen Duponceau, whose specialty
was the Delaware language, wholly and deliberately ignored
everything by the author of "The American Nations."</p>

<p class="indent">Why was this?</p>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque was poor, eccentric, negligent of his
person, full of impractical schemes and extravagant theories, and
manufactured and sold in a small way a secret nostrum which
he called "pulmel," for the cure of consumption. All these
were traits calculated to lower him in the respect of the citizens
of Philadelphia, and the consequence was, that although a
member of some scientific societies, he seems to have taken
no part in their proceedings, and was looked upon as an undesirable
acquaintance, and as a sort of scientific outcast.</p>

<p class="indent">As early as 1819 Prof. Benjamin Silliman declined to
publish contributions from him in the "American Journal of Science,"
<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a>
and returned him his MSS. Dr. Gray strongly intimates that
Rafinesque's assertions on scientific matters were at times
intentionally false, as when he said that he had seen Robin's
collection of Louisiana plants in France, whereas that botanist
never prepared dried specimens; and the like.</p>

<p class="indent">I felt early in this investigation that Rafinesque's
assertions were, therefore, an insufficient warranty for the authenticity
of this document.</p>

<p class="indent">As I failed in my efforts to substantiate them by
local researches in Kentucky and Indiana, I saw that the evidence
must come from the text itself. Nor would it be sufficient to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
prove that the words of the text were in the Lenape dialect.
With Zeisberger and Heckewelder at hand, both of whose
works had been years in print, it were easy to string together
Lenape words.</p>

<p class="indent">But what Rafinesque certainly had not the ability
to do, was to write a sentence in Lenape, to compose lines which an
educated native would recognize as in the syntax of his own
speech, though perhaps dialectically different.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the test that I determined to apply.
I therefore communicated my doubts to my friend, the distinguished
linguist, Mr. Horatio Hale, and asked him to state them to
the Rev. Albert Anthony, a well educated native Delaware,
equally conversant with his own tongue and with English.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Anthony considered the subject fully, and concluded
by expressing the positive opinion that the text as given was
a genuine <i>oral</i> composition of a Delaware Indian. In many
lines the etymology and syntax are correct; in others there
are grammatical defects, which consist chiefly in the omission
of terminal inflections.</p>

<p class="indent">The suggestion he offered to explain these defects
is extremely natural. The person who wrote down this oral
explanation of the signs, or, to speak more accurately, these
chants which the signs were intended to keep in memory, was
imperfectly acquainted with the native tongue, and did not
always catch terminal sounds. The speaker also may have
used here and there parts of that clipped language, or "white
man's Indian," which I have before referred to as serving for
the trading tongue between the two races.</p>

<p class="indent">This was also the opinion of the Moravian natives
who examined the text. They all agreed that it impressed them as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
being of aboriginal origin, though the difference of the forms
of words left them often in the dark as to the meaning.</p>

<p class="indent">This very obscurity is in fact a proof that Rafinesque
did not manufacture it. Had he done so, he would have used the
"Mission Delaware" words which he found in Zeisberger.
But the text has quite a number not in that dialect, nor in
any of the mission dictionaries.</p>

<p class="indent">Moreover, had he taken the words from such sources,
he would in his translation have given their correct meanings;
but in many instances he is absurdly far from their sense.
Thus he writes: "The word for angels, <i>angelatawiwak</i>, is
not borrowed, but real Linapi, and is the same as the Greek
word <i>angelos</i>;"<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a>
whereas it is a verbal with a future sense
from the very common Delaware verb <i>angeln</i>, to die. Many
such examples will be noted in the vocabulary on a later page.</p>

<p class="indent">In several cases the figures or symbols appear to
me to bear out the corrected translations which I have given of the
lines, and not that of Rafinesque. This, it will be observed,
is an evidence, not merely that he must have received this
text from other hands, but the figures also, and weighs
heavily in favor of the authentic character of both.</p>

<p class="indent">That it is a copy is also evident from some manifest
mistakes in transcription, which Rafinesque preserves in his
printed version, and endeavored to translate, not perceiving
their erroneous form. Thus, in the fourth line of the first
chant, he wrote <i>owak</i>, translating it "much air or clouds,"
when it is clearly a mere transposition for <i>woak</i>, the Unami
form of the conjunction "and," as the sense requires. No
such blunder would appear if he had forged the document.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
It is true that a goodly share of the words in the earlier
chants occur in Zeisberger. Thus it seems, at first sight,
suspicious to find the three or four superlatives in III, 5, all
given under examples of the superlatives, in Zeisberger's
<i>Grammar</i>, p. 105. It looks as if they had been bodily
transferred into the song. So I thought; but afterwards I
found these same superlatives in Heckewelder, who added
specifically that "the Delawares had formed them to address
or designate the Supreme being."<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p class="indent">If we assume that this song is genuine, then
Zeisberger was undoubtedly familiar with some version of it; had
learned it probably, and placed most of its words in his
vocabulary.</p>

<p class="indent">Some other collateral evidences of authenticity I
have referred to on previous pages (<a href="#Page_67">pp. 67</a>,
<a href="#Page_89">89</a>, <a href="#Page_136">136</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">From these considerations, and from a study of the text,
the opinion I have formed of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>
is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">It is a genuine native production, which was repeated
orally to some one indifferently conversant with the Delaware
language, who wrote it down to the best of his ability. In
its present form it can, as a whole, lay no claim either to
antiquity, or to purity of linguistic form. Yet, as an authentic
modern version, slightly colored by European teachings, of
the ancient tribal traditions, it is well worth preservation,
and will repay more study in the future than is given it in
this volume. The narrator was probably one of the native
chiefs or priests, who had spent his life in the Ohio and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
Indiana towns of the Lenape, and who, though with some
knowledge of Christian instruction, preferred the pagan rites,
legends and myths of his ancestors. Probably certain lines
and passages were repeated in the archaic form in which
they had been handed down for generations.</p>

<h3><i>Phonetic System.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The phonetic system adopted by the writer, whoever
he was, is not that of the Moravian brethren. They employed
the German alphabet, which does not obtain in the present
text. On this point Rafinesque says: "The orthography of
the Linapi names is reduced to the Spanish or French pronunciation,
except <i>sh</i>, as in English; <i>u</i>, as in French; <i>w</i>, as
in <i>how</i>."<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
A comparison of the words with their equivalents
in Zeisberger's spelling shows that this is generally true.</p>

<p class="indent">It is obvious that the gutturals are few and soft,
and that the process of synthesis is carried further than in the Minsi
dialect. For this reason, from the introduction of peculiar
words, and from the loss of certain grammatical terminations,
the Minsi Delawares of to-day, to whom I have submitted it,
are of the opinion that it belongs to one of the southern
dialects of their nation; perhaps to the Unalachtgo, as suggested
by Chief Gabriel Tobias, in his letter printed on a
preceding page (<a href="#Page_88">p. 88</a>).</p>

<h3><i>Metrical Form.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">Even to an ear not acquainted with the language, the
chants of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span> are obviously in metrical
arrangement. The rhythm is syllabic and accentual, with frequent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
effort to select homophones (to which the correct form of
the words is occasionally sacrificed), and sometimes alliteration.
Iteration is also called in aid, and the metrical scheme
is varied in the different chants.</p>

<p class="indent">All these rhythmical devices appear in the native
American songs of many tribes, though I cannot point to any other
strictly aboriginal production in Algonkin, where a tendency
toward rhyme is as prominent as in the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>.
It is well to remember, however, that our material for comparison
is exceedingly scanty, and also that for nearly three fourths
of a century before this song was obtained, the music-loving
Moravian missionaries had made the Delawares familiar with
numerous hymns in their own tongue, correctly framed and rhymed.</p>

<h3><i>Pictographic System</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The pictographic system which the
<span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span> presents
is clearly that of the Western Algonkins, most familiar to us
through examples from the Chipeways and Shawnees. It is
quite likely, indeed, that it was the work of a Shawnee, as
we know that they supplied such songs, with symbols, to the
Chipeways, and were intimately associated with the Delawares.</p>

<p class="indent">At the time Rafinesque wrote, Tanner's <i>Narrative</i>
had been in print several years, and the numerous examples of
Algonkin pictography it contains were before him. Yet it
must be said that the pictographs of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>
have less resemblance to these than to those published by the
Chipeway chief, George Copway, in 1850, and by Schoolcraft,
in his "History and Statistics of the Indian Tribes."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
There is generally a distinct, obvious connection between
the symbol and the sense of the text, sufficient to recall the
latter to one who has made himself once thoroughly familiar
with it. I have not undertaken a study of the symbols; but
have confined myself to a careful reproduction of them, and
the suggestion of their more obvious meanings, and their
correspondences with the pictographs furnished by later
writers. I shall leave it for others to determine to what
extent they should be accepted as a pure specimen of Algonkin
pictographic writing.</p>

<h3><i>Derivation of Walam Olum.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The derivation of the name <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>
has been largely anticipated on previous pages. I have shown that <i>wâlâm</i>
(in modern Minsi, <i>wâlumin</i>) means "painted," especially
"painted <i>red</i>." This is a secondary meaning, as the root
wuli conveys the idea of something pleasant, in this connection,
pleasant to the eye, fine, pretty. (<a href="#Page_104">See ante p. 104</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Olum</i> was the name of the scores, marks, or
figures in use on the tally-sticks or record-boards. The native Delaware
missionary, Mr. Albert Anthony says that the knowledge of
these ancient signs has been lost, but that the word <i>olum</i> is
still preserved by the Delaware boys in their games when
they keep the score by notches on a stick. These notches&mdash;
not the sticks&mdash;are called to this day <i>olum</i>&mdash;an interesting
example of the preservation of an archaic form in the language
of children.</p>

<p class="indent">The name <i>Wâlâm Olum</i> is therefore a highly appropriate
one for the record, and may be translated "<span class="smcap">Red Score</span>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<h3>
<i>The MS. of the</i> <b><span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span></b>.</h3>

<p class="indent">The MS. from which I have printed the
<span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span> is a
small quarto of forty unnumbered leaves, in the handwriting
of Rafinesque. It is in two parts with separate titles. The
first reads:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center space-above2"><b><span class="smcap">Walamolum</span></b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot space-below2">
First Part of the painted-engraved ║ traditions of the Linni

<p class="indent">Translated word for word by means of Zeisberger and

<p class="indent">By C S Rafinesque 1833</p>
</div>

<p class="indent space-above1">When Rafinesque died, his MSS. were scattered
and passed into various hands. Prof. Haldeman, in his notice above referred
to (<a href="#Page_150">p. 150</a>), stated that he and "Mr. Poulson of Philadelphia"
had a large part of them.</p>

<p class="indent">This particular one, and also others descriptive of
Rafinesque's archaeological explorations in the southwest, his surveys
of the earthworks of Kentucky and the neighboring states,
and the draft of a work on "The Ancient Monuments of
North and South America," came into the possession of the
Hon. Brantz Mayer, of Baltimore, distinguished as an able
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
public man and writer on American subjects, from whose
family I obtained them.</p>

<p class="indent">He loaned them all to Mr. E. G. Squier, who made
extensive use of Rafinesque's surveys, in the "Ancient Monuments
of the Mississippi Valley," giving due credit.</p>

<p class="indent">In June, 1848, Mr. Squier read before the New York
Historical Society a paper entitled, "Historical and Mythological
Traditions of the Algonquins; with a translation of the
'Walum-Olum,' or Bark Record of the Linni-Lenape." This
was published in the "American Review," February, 1849,
and has been reprinted by Mr. W. W. Beach, in his "Indian
Miscellany" (Albany, 1877), and in the fifteenth edition of
Mr. S. G. Drake's "Aboriginal Races of North America."</p>

<p class="indent">This paper gave the symbols, original text and Rafinesque's
translation of the first two songs, and a free translation only,
of the remainder. The text was carelessly copied, whole
words being omitted, and no attempt was made to examine
the accuracy of the translation; the symbols were also imperfect,
several being reversed. Hence, as material for a critical study
of the document, Squier's essay is of little value.</p>

<p class="indent">At the close of the second part of the MS. there
are four pages, closely written, with the title:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent blockquot">"Fragment on the History of the Linapis since abt 1600
when the <i>Wallamolum</i> closes translated from the Linapi by John Burns."</p>

<p>This was printed by Rafinesque and Squier, but as it has no
original text, as nothing is known of "John Burns," and as
the document itself, even if reasonably authentic, has no historic
value, I omit it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<h3><i>General Synopsis of the Walam Olum.</i></h3>

<p class="indent">The myths embodied in the earlier portion
of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>
are perfectly familiar to one acquainted with Algonkin
mythology. They are not of foreign origin, but are wholly
within the cycle of the most ancient legends of that stock.
Although they are not found elsewhere in the precise form
here presented, all the figures and all the leading incidents
recur in the native tales picked up by the Jesuit missionaries
in the seventeenth century, and by Schoolcraft, McKinney,
Tanner and others in later days.</p>

<p class="indent">In an earlier chapter I have collected the
imperfect fragments of these which we hear of among the Delawares,
and these are sufficient to show that they had substantially the
same mythology as their western relatives.</p>

<p class="indent">The cosmogony describes the formation of the
world by the Great Manito, and its subsequent despoliation by the
spirit of the waters, under the form of a serpent. The happy
days are depicted, when men lived without wars or sickness,
and food was at all times abundant. Evil beings, of mysterious
power, introduced cold and war and sickness and
premature death. Then began strife and long wanderings.</p>

<p class="indent">However similar this general outline may be to
European and Oriental myths, it is neither derived originally from
them, nor was it acquired later by missionary influence.
This similarity is due wholly to the identity of psychological
action, the same ideas and fancies arising from similar impressions
in New as well as Old World tribes. No sound
ethnologist, no thorough student in comparative mythology,
would seek to maintain a genealogical relation of cultures on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
the strength of such identities. They are proofs of the
oneness of the human mind, and nothing more.</p>

<p class="indent">As to the historical portion of the document, it
must be judged by such corroborative evidence as we can glean from
other sources. I have quoted, in an earlier chapter, sufficient
testimony to show that the Lenape had traditions similar to
these, extending back for centuries, or at least believed by
their narrators to reach that far. What trust can be reposed
in them is for the archaeologist to judge.</p>

<p class="indent">Authentic history tells us nothing about the migrations
of the Lenape before we find them in the valley of the Delaware.
There is no positive evidence that they arrived there from
the west; still less concerning their earlier wanderings.</p>

<p class="indent">Were I to reconstruct their ancient history from the
<span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span>, as I understand it, the result
would read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">At some remote period their ancestors dwelt
far to the northeast, on tide-water, probably at Labrador
(<a href="#Page_145">Compare ante, p. 145</a>). They journeyed south and west,
till they reached a broad water, full of islands and abounding in fish,
perhaps the St. Lawrence about the Thousand Isles. They
crossed and dwelt for some generations in the pine and
hemlock regions of New York, fighting more or less with the
Snake people, and the Talega, agricultural nations, living in
stationary villages to the southeast of them, in the area of
Ohio and Indiana. They drove out the former, but the latter
remained on the upper Ohio and its branches. The Lenape,
now settled on the streams in Indiana, wished to remove to
the East to join the Mohegans and other of their kin who had
moved there directly from northern New York. They, therefore,
united with the Hurons (Talamatans) to drive out the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Talega (Tsalaki, Cherokees) from the upper Ohio. This they
only succeeded in accomplishing finally in the historic period
(<a href="#Page_17">see ante p. 17</a>). But they did clear the road and reached
the Delaware valley, though neither forgetting nor giving up
their claims to their western territories (<a href="#Page_144">see ante p. 144</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">In the sixteenth century the Iroquois tribes seized
and occupied the whole of the Susquehanna valley, thus cutting off
the eastern from the western Algonkins, and ended by driving
many of the Lenape from the west to the east bank of the
Delaware (<a href="#Page_38">ante p. 38</a>,).</p>

<h3><i>Synopsis of the separate parts.</i></h3>

<h4>I.</h4>

<p class="indent">The formation of the universe by the Great Manito
is described. In the primal fog and watery waste he formed land
and sky, and the heavens cleared. He then created men and
animals. These lived in peace and joy until a certain evil
manito came, and sowed discord and misery.</p>

<p class="indent">This canto is a version of the Delaware tradition
mentioned in the Heckewelder MSS. which I have given previously,
<a href="#Page_135">p. 135</a>. The notion of the earth rising from the primal waters
is strictly a part of the earliest Algonkin mythology, as I have
amply shown in previous discussions of the subject. See my
<i>Myths of the New World</i>, p. 213, and
<i>American Hero Myths</i>, Chap. II.</p>

<h4>II.</h4>

<p class="indent">The Evil Manito, who now appears under the guise
of a gigantic serpent, determines to destroy the human race, and
for that purpose brings upon them a flood of water. Many
perish, but a certain number escape to the turtle, that is, to
solid land, and are there protected by Nanabush (Manibozho or Michabo).
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
They pray to him for assistance, and he caused
the water to disappear, and the great serpent to depart.</p>

<p class="indent">This canto is a brief reference to the conflict
between the Algonkin hero god and the serpent of the waters,
originally, doubtless, a meteorological myth. It is an ancient
and authentic aboriginal legend, shared both by Iroquois and
Algonkins, under slightly different forms. In one aspect, it
is the Flood or Deluge Myth. For the general form of this
myth, see my <i>Myths of the New World</i>, pp. 119, 143, 182,
and <i>American Hero Myths</i>, p. 50, and authorities there
quoted; also, E. G. Squier, "Manabozho and the Great
Serpent; an Algonquin Tradition," in the <i>American Review</i>,
Vol. II, Oct., 1848.</p>

<h4>III.</h4>

<p class="indent">The waters having disappeared, the home of the
tribe is described as in a cold northern clime. This they concluded
to leave in search of warmer lands. Having divided their
people into a warrior and a peaceful class, they journeyed
southward, toward what is called the "Snake land." They
approached this land in winter, over a frozen river. Their
number was large, but all had not joined in the expedition
with equal willingness, their members at the west preferring
their ancient seats in the north to the uncertainty of southern
conquests. They, however, finally united with the other
bands, and they all moved south to the land of spruce pines.</p>

<h4>IV.</h4>

<p class="indent">The first sixteen verses record the gradual conquest
of most of the Snake land. It seems to have required the successive
efforts of six or seven head chiefs, one after another,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
to bring this about, probably but a small portion at a time
yielding to the attacks of these enemies. Its position is
described as being to the southwest, and in the interior of
the country. Here they first learned to cultivate maize.</p>

<p class="indent">The remainder of the canto is taken up with a long
list of chiefs, and with the removal of the tribe, in separate bands
and at different times, to the east. In this journey from the
Snake land to the east, they encountered and had long wars
with the Talega. These lived in strong towns, but by the
aid of the Hurons (Talamatans), they overcame them and
drove them to the south.</p>

<h4>V.</h4>

<p class="indent">Having conquered the Talegas, the Lenape possessed
their land and that of the Snake people, and for a certain time
enjoyed peace and abundance. Then occurred a division of
their people, some, as Nanticokes and Shawnees, going to
the south, others to the west, and later, the majority toward
the east, arriving finally at the Salt sea, the Atlantic ocean.
Thence a portion turned north and east, and encountered
the Iroquois. Still later, the three sub-tribes of the Lenape
settled themselves definitely along the Delaware river, and
received the geographical names by which they were known,
as Minsi, Unami and Unalachtgo (<a href="#Page_36">see ante, p. 36</a>). They
were often at war with the Iroquois, generally successfully.
Rumors of the whites had reached them, and finally these
strangers approached the river, both from the north (New
York bay) and the south. Here the song closes.

<h2>NOTES</h2>
<hr class="r5" />
<h3>I.</h3>
<p class="indent">&#8658;The references to authorities on Algonkin picture-writing
are the Appendix to <i>Tanner's Narrative of Captivity and Adventures</i>,
Copway's <i>Traditional History of the Ojibway Nation</i>, and
Schoolcraft's <i>Synopsis of Indian Symbols</i>, in Vol. I of his
<i>History and Statistics of the Indian Tribes</i>. I have not pursued
an investigation of the symbols beyond the first chant.</p>

<p class="indent">1. Rafinesque translates <i>wemiguna</i> "all sea water."
The proper form is <i>wemmguna</i>, "at all times" (Anthony). The symbol is
that of the sky and clouds above the earth. Compare Copway,
p. 134; Schoolcraft, <i>Synopsis</i>, Fig. 17.</p>

<p class="indent">2. <i>Kwelik</i>, a dialectic form of <i>quenek</i>, Z. long,
stretched out. <i>Kitanito</i>, a compound of <i>kehtan</i>, great, and
<i>manito</i>, mysterious being, is rendered by Raf. as Creator;
<i>wit</i> is the substantive verbaffix.</p>

<p class="indent">Heckewelder (MSS.) distinguishes between the synthetic
form, <i>ketanittowit</i>, which he translates "Majestic Being," and the
analytic form, <i>kitschi manito</i>, which he renders "Supreme
Wonder-doer." In the latter, the sense of <i>manito</i> is brought out.
In the Delaware and related dialects it conveys the idea of making,
or doing (<i>maniton</i>, to make, Zeisberger, <i>Gram.</i>, p. 222;
<i>maranito taendo</i>, make a fire, Campamus; Chipeway,
<i>win ma-nitawito</i> he himself makes it, or, can make it).</p>

<p class="indent">The idea of making or creating is at the bottom of many
native titles to supernatural powers, as the Shawnee <i>We-shellaqua</i>,
"he that made us all." (Rev. David Jones, Journal of Two Visits,
etc., p. 62.) See notes to line four. The Algonkin root, <i>etu</i>,
he does, he acts, he makes, would therefore seem to be a radical of
the word. (See Howse, <i>Gram. of the Cree Lang</i>., p. 160.)</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Trumbull, on the other hand, believes the only radical
to be <i>an</i>, = <i>el</i> or <i>al</i>, in the sense of "to be more than,"
"to surpass," "to exceed;" and maintains that the syllable <i>it</i>,
of the theme <i>manit</i>, is a formative suffix. (In <i>Old and New</i>, March, 1870.)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">Heckewelder, in his translation "wonder-doer," recognizes
the force of both elements, and from the analogous expressions I have
quoted, is probably correct. The element <i>an</i> is thus an intensive
prefix to the real root <i>it</i>, and the compound radical thus formed
in the third person, singular, <i>månito</i>, means "he or it does or
acts in a surpassing or extraordinary manner."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Essop</i>, pl. <i>essopak</i>, frequently recurring
words, are suppositive (<a href="#Page_90">see p. 90</a>) forms of the verb <i>lissin</i>,
"to be or do so, to be so situated, disposed, <i>or</i> acting" (Zeisberger,
<i>Gram.</i> p. 117). The terminal <i>p</i> is the sign of the
preterite. They are dialectic for <i>elsitup</i> and <i>elsichtitup</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">The symbol of a head with rays represents a manito.
Schoolcraft, <i>Synopsis</i>, Fig. 10.</p>

<p class="indent">3. Squier omits the word <i>elumamek</i>. These terms
are formal epithets applied to the highest divinity. <a href="#Page_158">See page 158</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">Squier also adds that Fig. 3 represents the sun, and is the
symbol of the Great Spirit. Both these statements are incorrect. The oval
is the earth-plain, with its four cardinal points, and the dot in the
centre signifies the spirit. See Copway, p. 135.</p>

<p class="indent">4. <i>Sohalawak</i> is not a Delaware form, but is a true Algonkin
word, as seen in the Cree <i>ooseh-ayoo</i>, animate, <i>ooseh-taw</i>,
inanimate, he, it, makes, produces. (Howse, <i>Cree Grammar</i>,p. 166.)
It appears in the Shawnee <i>w'shellaqua</i>, quoted in notes
to verse 2; in the Minsi dialect the corresponding word is
<i>kwishelmawak</i>; <i>owak</i> is a mistake for <i>woak</i>,
and Rafinesque translates it "much air." <i>Awasagamak</i>, heaven,
sky, literally, "the land or place beyond," from <i>awossi</i>,
beyond; but Dr. Trumbull prefers a derivation
from a root signifying "light," <i>Del. waseleu</i>, it is clear or
bright (Trans. Am. Philol. Soc., 1872, p. 164); this latter appears
to me overstrained. The symbol is the earth surmounted by the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">5. The symbol represents the sun, moon and stars in
the sky, which is repeated with change of relative positions in the next
verse. In Minsi, the fifth line would read, <i>Kwishelmawak kischohk
nipahenk alankwewak</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">7. On the termination <i>wagan</i> <a href="#Page_101">see page 101</a>. The prefix
<i>ksh</i>, properly <i>k'sch</i>, is intensive, as it is an abbreviation of
<i>kitschi</i>, great, large. Thus <i>sokelan</i>, it rains,
<i>k'schilan</i>, it rains very hard.</p>

<p class="indent">The symbol seems to indicate the waters flowing off.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">8. Mr. Anthony renders this line in Minsi:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Pilikin</i>&emsp; &emsp;<i>ameni-menayen</i>&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;<i>epit</i>,<br />
&nbsp; Grew-clean&emsp; groups of islands&emsp; where they are,</p>

<p class="indent">That is, that the islands rose dry and clean from
the water, as they now are found.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Delsin-epit</i>; the first part of this compound,
properly <i>w'dell-sinewo</i>, is the indicative present, 3d p. pi.,
of <i>lissin</i>, to be thus, or so situated; <i>epit</i> is what
Zeisberger (<i>Gram.</i> p. 115) calls the "adverbial" form of
<i>achpin</i>, to be there, in a particular place. This adverbial
is really the suppositive form of the verb, after the vowel-change
has taken place. (<a href="#Page_107">See above, page 107</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent">Former renderings of the line are: "It looks bright,
and islands stood there" (Rafinesque). "All was made bright, and the
islands were brought into being" (Squier).</p>

<p class="indent">The symbol is a three cornered point of land, rising
above the water under the sky.</p>

<p class="indent">9. <i>Manito manitoak</i>, "made the makers'," Raf.;
"made the Great Spirits," Squier. Either of these renderings is defensible,
as will appear from the senses of <i>manito</i>, above given.</p>

<p class="indent">This line can be read in Minsi,
<i>Lapi-up Kehtanitowit man'ito mani'towak</i>, Again-he-spake, Great-Spirit,
a spirit, spirits. The symbol represents the communion of the spirits.
Compare Tanner, <i>Narrative</i>, p. 359, fig. 24.</p>

<p class="indent">10. Raf. and Squier absurdly translate <i>angelatawiwak</i>,
angels. It is from a familiar Del. verb, <i>angeln</i>, to die. Compare Abnaki
<i>8anangmes8ak</i>, "revenants," Rasles, and <i>w'tanglowagan</i>, his
death, Zeis. The form in the text, according to Mr. Anthony, has the sense,
"things destined to die," mortal, perishable. He gives the line in Minsi as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Aweniwak</i>&emsp; <i>angelatawawak</i>&emsp; <i>wtschitsch'wankwak</i>&emsp; <i>wemiwak</i>,<br />
&emsp; &emsp;Beings&emsp; &emsp; &emsp;mortals&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; souls&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;and all</p>

<p>The <i>wak</i> of the last word is not the plural but the conjunction
"and;" as in the Latin, <i>omniaque</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">11. Raf. translates <i>jinwis</i> as "man-being," and Squier
thinks it the Chipeway <i>inini</i>, men; but it appears to be the adverb
<i>janwi</i>, ever, always. The symbol is apparently that of birth,
or being born. Compare Tanner, <i>Narr.</i>, p. 351, fig. 1, with
that meaning, an armless figure with wide spread legs.</p>

<p class="indent">12. The pictograph is a woman, with breasts, but armless.
The "first mother" here represented was an important personage in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
the mythology of the Chipeways and neighboring tribes. She was
called "the grandmother of mankind" (<i>Me-suk-kum-me-go-kwa</i>,
in Dr. James' orthography), and it was to her that Nanabush
(Manibozho), imparted the secrets of all roots, herbs and plants.
Hence, the medicine men direct their songs and addresses to her
whenever they take anything from the earth which is to be used as
a medicine. Tanner's <i>Narrative</i>, p. 355.</p>

<p class="indent">13. The figure of a square, the world, with the four
varieties of animals named.</p>

<p class="indent">14. The bad spirit was, in Algonkin mythology, the
water god, and was represented as a serpent-like figure. See Copway,
pp. 134, 135. Schoolcraft, <i>Synopsis</i>, figs. 93, 100.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Amangamek</i>, plural form of the compound <i>amangi</i>,
great; <i>namaes</i> fish; but <i>amangi</i> has the associate idea of
terrifying, frightful, hence the reference is to some mythical water
monster (Cree, <i>am</i>, faire peur, Lacombe).</p>

<p class="indent">Raf. translates both <i>nakowak</i> in this line, and
<i>nakowa</i>, in II, 6, as "black snake." They can have no such meaning,
black, in Lenape, being <i>suckeu</i>, and in none of the Algonkin dialects
does <i>nak</i> mean black.</p>

<p class="indent">16. The figure represents the earth-plain under the form
of the area of a lodge, with central fire and the people in it, typifying
friendliness. Comp. Tanner, <i>Narr.</i>, p. 348, fig. I.</p>

<p class="indent">V. 16 pursues the topic of v. 13, and it looks as if
v. 14 and 15 should be transposed to follow v. 20.</p>

<p class="indent">17. The former renderings are.&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">"Thou being Kiwis, good God Wunand, and the
good makers were such."&mdash;<i>Rafinesque.</i></p>

<p class="indent">"There being a good god, all spirits were good."&mdash;<i>Squier.</i></p>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque mistook the adverb <i>kiwis</i> for a proper name.</p>

<p class="indent">18. Raf. translates <i>nijini</i>, the Jins, and <i>nantinewak</i>,
fairies, and Squier follows him in the latter, but could not go as far
as the former! As seen in the vocabulary, I attach wholly different
notions to these words. The two figures united refer to the sexual
relation. Compare Tanner, <i>Narr.</i>, pp. 371, figs. 8, 9.</p>

<p class="indent">19. <i>Gattamin</i> cannot mean "fat fruit," as Raf.
translates it. He has evidently mistaken the explanation given by Heckewelder,
of Catawissa, <i>Gattawisu</i>, becoming fat, and thought that
<i>gatta</i>, was fat, whereas <i>wisu</i> is "fat." (Zeis. <i>Gram.</i>, p. 229.)
<i>Wakon</i> is understood by Rafinesque as the proper name of the
evil spirit, connecting it with the Dakota <i>wakan</i>, divine, supernatural.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">20. The dream of "the good old times," the happy
epoch of yore, when men dwelt in peace and prosperity, was, as I
have shown, page 135, a myth of the Delawares, and George
Copway tells us that the Chipeway legends also recalled it with delight.
(<i>Traditional History of the Ojibway Nation</i>, pp. 98 and 169-175.)</p>

<p class="indent">21. The symbol is the same as that of the
"bad spirit under the earth," given by Copway, p. 135.</p>

<p class="indent">A similar figure is given by Copway to signify "bad,"
p. 135. I do not understand its allusion.</p>

<p class="indent">22. <i>Mattalogas</i>; the prefix is the negative
<i>matta</i>, no, not, and generally conveys a bad sense, as <i>matteleman</i>,
to despise one, <i>mattelendam</i>, to be uneasy. Zeis.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Pallalogasin</i>, to sin, from <i>palli</i>, elsewhere, other
than, hence <i>pallhiken</i>, to shoot amiss, to miss the mark, to go wrong.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Maktaton</i>, unhappiness. There is a relation in Lenape
between the negative <i>matta</i>, in Minsi, <i>machta</i>, and the words for bad,
ugly, evil, and the like; <i>machtisisu</i>, here it is bad, or ugly.
<i>Zeisb.</i> It would seem to be an intuitive recognition of the
profound philosophical maxim that evil is ever a negation; that
Mephistopheles is, as he says in Faust&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Der Geist der stets vernemt"</p>

<p class="indent">23. The symbol is apparently trees on hills, bent by
a storm, and beneath a death's head.</p>

<p class="indent">24. The picture seems to be two countries connected by a bridge.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Atak kitahican</i>, = <i>attach</i>, beyond, above;
<i>kitahican</i>, the ocean, literally "the great tidal sea." It is possible
this has reference to the deluge, which is described in the next section;
but usually <i>kitahican</i> meant the ocean.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">II.</h3>

<p class="indent">1. <i>Maskanako</i>; the Lenape words would be <i>mechek</i>,
great, <i>achgook</i>, snake; but <i>maska</i> is more allied to the Cree
<i>maskaw</i>, strong, hard, solid. Raf. translates the close of the
line "when men had become bad."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">2. <i>Schingalan</i>, to hate; from the adjective <i>schingi</i>,
disliking, unwilling. This is the contrary of <i>wingi</i>, liking,
willing. Both are from the subjective radical <i>n</i> or <i>ni</i>,
I, <i>Ego</i>, the latter with the prefix <i>wĕl</i>, signifying
pleasurable sensation (<a href="#Page_104">see page 104</a>).</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Shawelendamep</i>, preterite form, strengthened by
the prefix <i>ksch</i>, of the verb <i>acquiwelendam</i>, Zeis., to disquiet,
to trouble; it has not the passive sense given in Rafinesque's
translation. All verbs terminating in <i>elendam</i> signify a
disposition of mind, the root being again the subjective <i>n</i>,
ego. Raf. translates: "This strong snake had become the foe of the
Jins, and they became troubled, hating each other."</p>

<p class="indent">3. <i>Palliton</i>, from <i>palli</i>, elsewhere (from what
was intended), hence "to spoil something, to do it wrong," and later
"to fall out, to fight."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Lungundowin</i>, from <i>langan</i>, easy, light to do, Chipeway,
<i>nin nangan</i>, I find it light, of no trouble; hence, "<i>peace</i>" as being a
time free from trouble; and by a third application of the idea,
<i>elangomellan</i>, friends, those who are at peace with us.</p>

<p class="indent">4. Raf. translates this line: "Less men with dead-keeper
fighting," which is a total misunderstanding of the words. On the
derivation of <i>nihanlowit</i> see <i>ante</i>, <a href="#Page_102">page 102</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">6. On <i>nakowa</i>, see I, line 14. Here I consider it a derivative
from <i>nacha</i>, three, and both the sense of the line and the symbol,
with three marks to the right of the figure, indicate this meaning.
The three antagonists are the monster, the waters, and the Great Snake himself.</p>

<p class="indent">7. The repetition of the words is to add force to the phrase.</p>

<p class="indent">8. This is an important line, as indicating the origin
of the Walam Olum. <i>Nanaboush</i> is not the Delaware form of the name
of the Algonkin hero-god, so far as known, but the Chipeway
<i>Nanabooshoo</i>, Tanner, <i>Nanibajou</i>, McKinney, properly <i>Nānâboj</i>,
the Trickster, the Cheater, allied to Chip. <i>nin nanabanis</i>, I am
cheated. This term, like the Cree <i>Wisakketjâk</i>, which has the
same meaning (<i>fourbe</i>, <i>trompeur</i>, Lacombe), was applied to the
hero-god of these nations on account of his exhaustless ingenuity
in devising tricks, ruses, disguises and transformations, to overcome
the various other divine powers with whom he came in conflict.
This seemingly depreciatory term arose from the same
admiration of versatility of powers which has imparted such universal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
popularity to the story of the wily (<b>πολυτροπος</b>) Ulysses,
and the trickery of Master Reynard.</p>

<p class="indent">The appearance of this form of the name indicates that
the version of the legend here given has been influenced by Chipeway
associations, as, indeed, we might expect, since it was obtained in
Indiana, where the Delawares were in constant intercourse with
their Chipeway neighbors.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Tulapit menapit = tulpe epit, menatey epit</i>, "it was then
at the turtle, it was then at the island." The form <i>Tula</i> has given rise to
the strangest theorizing about this line, as, of course, the antiquaries
could not resist the temptation to see in it a reference to the Tula
or Tollan of Aztec mythology, the capital city of the Toltecs and the
home of Quetzalcoatl.</p>

<p class="indent">The similarity of the words is purely fortuitous. The Lenape
word <i>tulpe</i> means turtle or tortoise, especially, says Zeisberger,
a water or sea turtle. In their mythology, as I have already shown
(<a href="#Page_134">ante, p. 134</a>) the earth was supposed to be floating on a boundless
ocean, as a turtle floats on the surface of a pond. Hence, symbolically,
the turtle represents the dry land.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Maskaboush</i> = Chip. <i>mashka</i>,
strong, <i>wabos</i>, usually translated
hare or rabbit, but really "White One." I have fully explained
this mistaken sense of the word in <i>American Hero Myths</i>,
pp. 41, 42, and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="indent">9. The Algonkin myth relates that Michabo or Nanaboj
after having formed the earth on the primal ocean, walked round and
round it, and by this act increased it constantly in size.</p>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque's translation is:&mdash;"Being born creeping, he
is ready to move and dwell at <i>Tula</i>;" and in his note to the line he adds,
"<i>Tula</i> is the ancient seat of the Toltecas and Mexican nations in
Asia; the <i>Tulan</i> or <i>Turan</i> of Central Tartary."</p>

<p class="indent">The entire absence of connected meaning in this and
other lines of Rafinesque's translation is strong evidence that he did
not fabricate the text; otherwise he would certainly have assigned
it some coherent sense.</p>

<p class="indent">The turtle is, as usual, the symbol of the land
or earth (<a href="#Page_133">see page 133</a>).</p>

<p class="indent">12. <i>Manito-dasin</i>, the Divine Maiden, or the Daughter
of the Gods, as it might be freely translated. The reference is to the
Virgin who at the beginning of things descended from heaven, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
alighting on the back of the turtle became the mother of Nanaboj
and his brothers. She was well known in Eastern Algonkin
mythology, as I have already shown. (<a href="#Page_131">See above, p. 131</a>.)</p>

<p class="indent">13. This and the three following verses form,
observes Rafinesque, a rhymed hymn to Nanabush.</p>

<p class="indent">14. In this line the men are referred to as <i>Linapi</i>,
not <i>lennowak</i> as before. Here then begins the particular history of
the Lenape tribe, whose chief sub-tribe was the Turtle clan.</p>

<p class="indent">The meaning of the line is very obscure. It seems to refer
to the origin of the Unami, or Turtle sub-tribe of the Delawares.</p>

<p class="indent">16. <i>Kwamipokho</i>, translated by Raf. "plain and mountain,"
does not appear to me to bear any such rendering. I take it as a
form of <i>champeecheneu</i>, Z. "it is still or stagnant water," the
appropriateness of which to the context is evident.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Sitwalikho</i>, Raf. renders "path of cave," deriving it obviously
from <i>tsit</i>, foot, and <i>woalheu</i>, a hole. It has no sort of meaning
in this rendering, and I assume, therefore, that it is a derivative
from <i>tschitqui</i>, silent.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Maskan wagan</i>, probably an error for <i>maskanakon</i>, as in v. I.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Palliwi, palliwi</i>, "is elsewhere, is elsewhere,"
or, "is foiled, is overcome."</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">III.</h3>

<p class="indent">1. <i>Wittank talli</i>: in the MS. these words are first
translated "dwelling town there," but the last two words are erased and "of
Talli" substituted. This is one of a number of instances where
Rafinesque altered his first translations, which is further evidence
that he did not manufacture the text. In this instance, as frequently,
he altered it for the worse. <i>Wittank</i> is from <i>witen</i>, to go
with or be with, Zeis., and <i>talli</i> is the adverb "there."</p>

<p class="indent">3. <i>Meshautang</i>, "many deer" (see Vocabulary),
translated by Rafinesque, "game."</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Siliewak</i>, rendered by Rafinesque <i>sili</i>, cattle,
<i>ewak</i>, they go. The <i>wak</i> is the terminal "and" (see notes to I. v. 10).
The word <i>sisile</i>, in modern Delaware <i>sizil'ia</i> (Whipple's Vocabulary),
means "buffalo." Its older form is seen in the MS. vocab. of
the New Jersey Indians, 1792, where it is <i>sisiliamuus</i>. This is
a compound of the generic termination <i>muus</i>, Cree, <i>mustus</i>
(whence our word "moose"), meaning any large quadruped, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
probably the prefix <i>tschilani</i> strong powerful with an intensive
reduplication</p>

<p class="indent">4. <i>Powalessin</i> from the same root as <i>powwow</i>
(<a href="#Page_70">see page 70</a>). The course of thought was that the dreamer
(<i>powwow</i>) became wise beyond his followers and hence obtained power and
riches though not of a martial character.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Elowichil</i> hunters <i>allowin</i> to hunt,
doubtless connected with <i>alluns</i> an arrow.</p>

<p class="indent">5, 6. A note in the MS states that the symbols of
these two verses were united together in the original drawings.</p>

<p class="indent">7. In this verse the pre-eminence of the Turtle sub-tribe
the Unami is asserted to have obtained from the most ancient times.</p>

<p class="indent">8. The verses 8, 9, 10 are referred in Rafinesque's free
translation to the Snake people. They seem to me to be descriptive
of the grief of the Lenape on leaving their ancient home.</p>

<p class="indent">12. <i>Pokhapokhapek</i>, Gaping Sea, Raf. Both this and
the preceding word are descriptive of the sea referred to as offering
means of subsistence <i>namaes</i> fish <i>pocqueu</i> muscles or clams
being the two main food products of the water for the Indians.</p>

<p class="indent">The location of this productive spot I leave for future
investigators to determine. The Detroit River and the Thousand Isles
in the St. Lawrence are the most appropriate localities to my mind.</p>

<p class="indent">13. The last word of the line is given in the MS. both
as <i>menakinep</i> and <i>akomenep</i> the latter a later interlineation.
I prefer the former.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Wapasinep</i>, may mean 'at the East' as well as 'in the
light.' The latter is a metaphor, common in the native tongues for prosperity.</p>

<p class="indent">Verses 13 to 20 inclusive were printed by Rafinesque in
the original and called by him, the poem on the passage to America, as
he understood this narrative to refer to the period when the ancestors
of the Lenape crossed Behring straits from Asia to America on the ice.</p>

<p class="indent">17. <i>Kitahican</i>, This is the term given by Zeisberger
to the Ocean. The prefix <i>Kit</i> is "great" and the termination <i>hican</i>
appears to have been confined to tidal waters (<a href="#Page_21">see above p. 21</a>).
Elsewhere this termination signifies an instrument. Probably it
was applicable to all large bodies of water.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
On <i>pokhakhopek</i>, doubtless a carelessness for <i>pokhapokhapek</i>,
line 12, see note to the latter.</p>

<p class="indent">18. Squier does not give the numerals, but says simply
"in vast numbers." No doubt this is the intention of the expression.</p>

<p class="indent">20. <i>Shiwaking</i>, "the place of spruce firs"
(see Vocab). They crossed in mid-winter a broad stream, rich in fish
and shell-fish, and arrived at a land covered with forests of spruce.
For a long time this appears to have remained their home.</p>

<h3 class="space-above2">IV.</h3>

<p class="indent">2. <i>Sittamaganat</i>, Raf. translates "Path Leader." The
word <i>tamaganat</i> appears in other verses, as <i>w'tamaganat</i>, IV, 37;
<i>tamaganat</i>, IV, 55; <i>tamaganend</i>, V, 2. I derive it from the root
<i>tam</i>, literally to drink, but generally, to smoke tobacco, as in
Roger Williams' Key <i>wut-tammagon</i>, a pipe (<a href="#Page_49">see above, page 49</a>).
Hence I take <i>tamagamat</i> to be the pipe-bearer, he who had charge
of the Sacred Calumet. If it is objected that this puts the use of
tobacco by the Lenape too remote, I reply that we do not know when they began
to use it, and moreover, this may be an anachronism of tradition.</p>

<p class="indent">13, 14. The lands toward the four cardinal points are
described from a centre where the tribe was then located. Neither
Rafinesque nor Squier understood this, and their renderings do not
mention the territories North and West. From the description, I
should place the then location of the tribe in Western New York
and Northern Ohio.</p>

<p class="indent">16. The four names seem to be appellatives of different
tribes. One of the extinct tribes remembered in Chipeway tradition was
the <i>Assigunaik</i>, Stone People (Schoolcraft, <i>History and Statistics
of the Ind. Tribes</i>, Vol. I, p. 305).</p>

<p class="indent">25. The legend here relates that the cultivation of maize
began after they had reached a low latitude, presumably Southern Indiana
or Ohio. The legend of the New England Indians was
that a crow flew down from the great God Kitantowit, bringing in
one ear a grain of corn, in the other a bean, and taught them the
cultivation of these plants. (Roger Williams, <i>Key into the Language
of America</i>, p. 114.) See further, <a href="#Page_48">ante, p. 48</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">34. <i>Wisawana</i>, the Yellow River. There is a
small river, so-called, in the State of Indiana, a branch of the Kankakee, called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
on Hough's "Map of the Indian Names of Indiana" <i>We-tho-gan</i>,
a corruption of <i>wisawanna</i>. (See Hough's map, in <i>Twelfth Annual
Report of the Geology and Natural History of Indiana</i>,
1883.) When the Minsi made their first migration west, about
1690, they directed their course to this spot, where they were found
by Charlevoix in 1721.</p>

<p class="indent">36. <i>Tamenend</i>, the name of the celebrated chief now
better known to us as Tammany, who dealt with William Penn. Heckewelder
translates it as "Affable." This is the first of the name.
A second is mentioned, V, 32. The friend of Penn was the third.</p>

<p class="indent">46. <i>Towakon pallitonep</i>, Raf. translates
"father snake, he was mad!"</p>

<p class="indent">48. Perhaps this line should be translated:
"They speak well of the east; many go to the east."</p>

<p class="indent">49. <i>Nemassipi</i>, Fish River. In the MS. this name
was first written <i>mixtu sipi</i>. The name "Fish River" was applied to
various streams by the Delawares, but never, so far as I know, to
the Mississippi. In the present connection it seems to refer either
to the St. Lawrence, about the Thousand Isles, or else its upper
stream, the Detroit River, both of which were famous fishing spots.</p>

<p class="indent">50. <i>Talligewi</i>. No name in the Lenape legends has
given rise to more extensive discussion than this. It is usually connected
with <i>Alligewi</i> and this again with <i>Alleghany</i>. This seems
supported by Loskiel, who, writing on the authority of Zeisberger,
says, "Nun nennen die Delawaren die ganze Gegend, so weit die
Gewässer reichen, die in dem Ohio fallen, Alligewinengk, welches
so viel bedeutet, als das Land, in welches sie sich aus weit entfernten
Orten begeben haben." (<i>Geschichte der Mission</i>, etc., p. 164.)</p>

<p class="indent">The meaning here assigned to Alligewinengk, "land where
they arrived from distant places," is evidently based on the resolution
of the compound into <i>talli</i>, there, <i>icku</i>, to that place, <i>ewak</i>,
they go, with a locative final. The initial <i>t</i> is often omitted in adverbial
compounds of <i>talli</i> (itself a compound of <i>ta</i>, locative particle, and
<i>li</i>, to), as <i>allamunk</i>, in there.</p>

<p class="indent">Bishop Ettwein gives to the word a different meaning.
He writes: "The Delawares call the western country <i>Alligewenork</i>,
which signifies a War-Path; the river itself they call <i>Alligewi Sipo</i>."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
(<i>Legends and Traditions</i>, etc., in <i>Bull. of the Pa. Hist. Soc.</i> p. 34.)
Here the derivation would be from <i>palliton</i>, to fight,
<i>ewak</i>, they go, and a locative, "they go there to fight." The
omission of the initial <i>p</i> was not uncommon, as Campanius gives
<i>ayuta = alliton</i>, to make war. (<i>Catechismus</i>, p. 141.)</p>

<p class="indent">Basing his opinion on an expression in the Journal of
C. F. Post, to the effect that Alleghany means "fine or fair river," Dr.
J. H. Trumbull analyzes it into <i>wulik, hanne, sipu</i>, which he translates
"best, rapid-stream, long-river" (<i>Connect. Hist. Soc. Colls.</i> Vol. II).</p>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque, in the MS. of the Walum Olum, gives Talligewi
the translation "there found," from <i>talli</i>, there, and I know not what
word for "found."</p>

<p class="indent">There have not been wanting those who would derive the
name Alleghany from Iroquois roots, as the Seneca <i>De-o-na-ga-no</i>,
"cold water" (<i>Amer. Hist. Mag.</i> Vol. IV, p. 184). But there is
no probability that the word is Iroquois.</p>

<p class="indent">Whatever its origin, the name was not confined to
the Alleghany river, but included the whole of the Upper Ohio, as the
interpreter Post distinctly says.</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Mr. Heckewelder was of opinion that <i>Talligewi</i>
was a word foreign to the Algonkin, a <i>nomen gentile</i> of another
tribe, adopted by the Delawares, just as they adopted <i>Mengwe</i> for
the Iroquois from the Onondaga <i>Yenkwe</i>, men (<a href="#Page_14">see above, page 14</a>).
It is not necessarily connected with Alleghany, which may
be pure Algonkin. He says, "Those people called themselves
<i>Talligeu</i> or <i>Talligewi</i>." (<i>Indian Nations</i> p. 48.) The accent,
as he gives it, <i>Tallige'wi</i>, shows that the word is, <i>Talliké</i>, with
the substantive verb termination, so that <i>Talligewi</i> means, "He is a
<i>Talliké</i>" or, "It is of (belongs to) the Talliké."</p>

<p class="indent">This appears to me the most probable supposition of
any I have quoted, and it reduces our quest to that of a nation who
called themselves by a name which, to Lenape ears, would sound like
<i>Talliké</i>. Such a nation presents itself at once in the Cherokees,
who call themselves <i>Tsa'laki</i>. Moreover, they fill the requirements
in other particulars. Their ancient traditions assign them a
residence precisely where the Delaware legends locate the Tallike,
to wit, on the upper waters of the Ohio (<a href="#Page_17">see above, page 17</a>).
Fragments of them continued there until within the historic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
period, and the persistent hostility between them and the Delawares
points to some ancient and important contest.</p>

<p class="indent">Name, location and legends, therefore, combine to identify
the Cherokees or Tsalaki with the Tallike, and this is as much evidence
as we can expect to produce in such researches. I can see
no reason whatever for Dr. Shea's opinion that the Lenape "in
their progress eastward drove out of Ohio the Quappas, called by
the Algonkins, Alkanzas or Alligewi, who retreated down the
Ohio and Mississippi." (Shea, Notes to Alsop's <i>Maryland</i>, p. 118.)</p>

<p class="indent">The question remains, whether the Tallike were the "Mound
Builders." It is not so stated in the <span class="smcap">Walum Olum</span>. The inference
rather is that the "Snake people," <i>Akowini</i> or <i>Akonapi</i>, dwelt
in the river valleys north of the Ohio river, in the area of Western
Ohio and Indiana, where the most important earthworks are
found&mdash;and singularly enough none more remarkable than the
immense effigy of the serpent in Adams County, Ohio, which winds
its gigantic coils over 700 feet in length on the summit of a bold
bluff overlooking Brush Creek.</p>

<p class="indent">According to the <span class="smcap">Red Score</span>,
the Snake people were conquered
by the Algonkins long before the contest with the Tallike began.
These latter lay between the position then occupied by the Lenape
and the eastern territory where they were found by the whites.
In other words, the Tallike were on the Upper Ohio and its tributaries,
and they had to be driven south before the path across the
mountains was open. For this reason they are called <i>wapawullaton</i>,
"possessing the East," that is, with reference to the then
position of the Lenape in southwestern Ohio.</p>

<p class="indent">54. <i>Talamatan</i>. This was the Lenape name of the
Huron-Iroquois or Wyandots. It is found in the form <i>Telamatinos</i>
in a "List of 11 Nations living West of Allegheny" present by deputy
at a Conference in Philadelphia, 1759 (<i>Minutes of the Prov Council
of Penna.</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 418). Heckewelder gives <i>Delamattenos</i>
(<i>Ind. Nations</i>, p. 80).</p>

<p class="indent">Rafinesque translates the name in one place by "not Talas,"
and in another by "not of us," from Len. <i>matta</i>, not, Latin <i>nos</i>,
us. That the Lenape did not speak Latin made no difference in
his linguistic theory, as he held all languages to be at core the
same! On the Hurons, <a href="#Page_16">see above, p. 16</a>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<h3 class="space-above2">V.</h3>

<p class="indent">2. <i>Wapalaneng</i>, apparently the White River,
Indiana, or else the Wabash.</p>

<p class="indent">16. In this line the three tribes are mentioned which were
previously named in IV, 44, 45, 46, and the difference in the spelling shows
that the chant was written down by one unacquainted with the forms of the
language. The correspondent names are:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p class="indent">The termination <i>ako</i>, uniformly rendered by Rafinesque
<i>snake</i>, appears to be either the animate plural in <i>ak</i>,
or the locative <i>aki</i>, place or land.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>Towako</i> are probably the Ot-tawa called by the
Delaware <i>Taway</i>; or the Twightees, called by them <i>Tawatatwee</i>
(see "List of 11 Nations," etc., in <i>Minutes of the
Prov. Council of Pa.</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 418).</p>

<p class="indent">There is difficulty in reconciling <i>Akowini</i> and
<i>Sinako</i>. In the former, the prefix <i>ako</i> may be from <i>achgook</i>,
snake, as Rafinesque and Squier rendered it.</p>

<p class="indent">The word <i>Lowanuski</i> appears again in v. 18, where Raf.
inserts the note, "Lowushkis are Esquimaux." It means simply "winter land,"
or "Northern people," and is not likely to have any reference to the Eskimo.</p>

<p class="indent">22. "Without snakes," <i>i. e.</i>, free from enemies.</p>

<p class="indent">24. On the derivation of Susquehannah, <a href="#Page_14">see page 14</a>.</p>

<p class="indent">25. <i>Winakaking</i>, Sassafras Land, the native name of eastern Pennsylvania.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX.</h2>
<hr class="r5" />
<h3>AGOZHAGÀUTA. (<a href="#Page_14"><i>page</i> 14. <i>Note</i></a>.)</h3>

<p class="indent">With reference to this word I have been favored with the opinions
of Gen. Clark, Mr. Horatio Hale, and the Rev. J. A. Cuoq, all able Iroquois scholars.</p>

<p class="indent">Gen. Clark and Mr. Hale believe that it is a dialectic or corrupt
form for <i>agotsaganha</i>, which is a derivature from <i>atsagannen</i>
(Bruyas, <i>Radices Verborum Iroquaeorum</i>, p. 42). This verbal
means, in one conjugation, "to speak a foreign language," and
in another, "to be of a different language, to be a foreigner." The
prefix <i>ago</i> or <i>ako</i> is an indefinite pronoun, having the same form
in both singular and plural, and is used with national or tribal
appellations, as in <i>akononsionni</i>, "People of the Long House,"
the general name of the Five Nations. Gen. Clark notes that the
term <i>agotsaganens</i>, or <i>agotsaganes</i>, was the term applied by the
Iroquois to the Mohegans, = "People who speak a foreign tongue."
(Jogues, <i>Novum Belgium</i> (1646), and <i>Pa. Colonial Records</i>, vol.
vi, p. 183.)</p>

<p class="indent">The Rev. Mr. Cuoq believes that the proper form is
<i>akotsakannha</i>, which in his alphabet is the same as <i>agotsaganha</i>,
but he limits its meaning to "on est Abnaquis," from <i>aktsakann</i>, "être
Abnaquis." (See his <i>Lexique de la Langue Iroquoise</i>, pp. 1, 155.)
The general name applied by the Iroquois to the Algonkins he
gives as <i>Ratirontaks</i>, from <i>karonta</i>, tree, and <i>ikeks</i>, to eat,
"Tree-eaters" (<i>Lexique</i>, p. 88); probably they were so called from their
love of the product of the sugar maple.</p>


<h3>DIALECT OF THE NEW JERSEY LENAPE. (<a href="#Page_46"><i>p. 46</i></a>)</h3>

<p class="indent">An interesting specimen of the South Jersey dialect of
the Lenape is preserved in the office of the Secretary of State, Trenton,
N.J. It is a list of 237 words and phrases obtained in 1684,
at Salem, N.J. It was published in the <i>American Historical
Record</i>, vol. I, pp. 308-311, 1872. The orthography is English,
and it is evidently the same trader's jargon which Gabriel Thomas
gives. (<a href="#Page_76">See p. 76</a>.) The <i>r</i> is frequent; man is <i>renus leno</i>;
devil is <i>manitto</i>; God is <i>hockung tappin</i> (literally, "he who is above").
There are several typographical errors in the printed vocabulary.

<h3>REV. ADAM GRUBE. (<a href="#Page_84"><i>p. 84.</i></a>)</h3>

<p class="indent">His full name was Bernhard Adam Grube. Between 1760-63
he was missionary in charge of the Moravian mission at Wechquetank,
Monroe County, Pa., and there translated into Delaware,
with the aid of a native named Anton, a "Harmony of the
Gospels," and prepared an "Essay of a Delaware Hymn Book."
Both these were printed by J. Brandmüller, at Friedensthal, Pa.,
and issued in 1763; but no copy of either is known to exist.</p>


<h3>EASTERN ORIGIN OF THE ALGONKINS.
 (<a href="#Page_12"><i>pp. 12</i></a> and <a href="#Page_145"><i>145.</i></a>)</h3>

<p class="indent">Quite recently M. Emile Petitot, in an article entitled,
"<i>De la pretendue Origine Orientale des Algonquins</i>" (<i>Bulletin de la
Société d'Anthropologie</i>, 1884, p. 248), has attacked the theory
that the Algonkin migrations were from the northeasterly portions
of the American continent, toward the west and south. His
arguments are based on two Cree legends which he relates, one of
which is certainly and the other probably of modern date, as the
incidents show; and on his criticism of the derivation of the name
"Abnaki". Of this he says: "<i>Wabang</i> signifie plutôt detroit que
orient; et quant au mot <i>askiy</i> ou <i>ahkiy</i>, il vent dire
<i>terre</i>, et non pas <i>peuple</i>".</p>

<p class="indent">Now, no one ever claimed that <i>abnaki</i> meant eastern
people. The Abbé Maurault translates the form <i>Abanki</i> by "terre au
Levant." (<i>Histoire des Abénakis</i>, Introd. p. ii, Quebec, 1866.)
In Cree <i>wapaw</i>, in Chipeway <i>wabi</i>, mean narrows or strait; but
they are derivatives from the root <i>wab</i>, and mean a light or open
place between two approaching shores, as Chip. <i>wabigama</i>, or
<i>wabimagad</i>, "there is a strait between the two shores." (Baraga,
<i>Otchipwe Dictionary</i>.) The name Abnaki is, moreover, no argument
either for or against the eastern origin of the Algonkin stock,
as it was merely a local term applied to a very small branch of it
by the French. Hence M. Petitot's criticisms on the theory under
consideration are misplaced and of no weight.</p>

<p class="indent">To what has been said in the text I may add that the
Algonkins who visited Montreal early in the 17th century retained distinct
traditions that they had once possessed the land to the east of that
city, and had been driven south and west by the Huron-Iroquois.
See the Abbé Maurault, <i>Histoire des Abénakis</i>, p. 111, and Wm.
W. Warren, <i>Hist. of the Ojibways</i>, Chap. IV (Minnesota, Hist. Colls., 1885).

<p class="f150"><b>LIBRARY</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>&mdash; OF &mdash;</b></p>
<p class="f200"><b>ABORIGINAL AMERICAN LITERATURE,</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>GENERAL EDITOR AND PUBLISHER:</b></p>
<p class="f120"><b>D. G. BRINTON, M.D.</b></p>
<hr class="tb" />
<p class="indent blockquot">The aim of this series of publications is to put within the reach
of scholars authentic materials for the study of the languages and culture of the native races
of America. Each work is the production of the native mind, and is printed in the original
tongue, with a translation and notes, and only such are selected as have some intrinsic
historical or ethnological importance. The volumes of the series are sold separately,
at the prices named.</p>

<p class="center u"><b>NOW READY.</b></p>
<p class="f150"><b>No. I. THE CHRONICLES OF THE MAYAS.</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>Edited by DANIEL G. BRINTON, M.D. 279 pages. Cloth, uncut, $5.00.<br />
($3.00 when a complete set is ordered.)</b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">This volume contains five brief chronicles in the Maya language
of Yucatan, written shortly after the Conquest, and carrying the history of that people back
many centuries. To these is added a history of the Conquest, written in his native tongue,
by a Maya Chief, in 1562. The texts are preceded by an introduction on the history of the Mayas;
their language, calendar, numeral system, etc.; and a vocabulary is added at the close.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>No. II. THE IROQUOIS BOOK OF RITES.</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>Edited by HORATIO HALE. 222 pages. Cloth, uncut, $3.00.</b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">This work contains, in the Mohawk and Onondaga languages, the
speeches, songs and rituals with which a deceased chief was lamented and his successor
installed in office. It may be said to throw a distinct light on the authentic history
of Northern America to a period fifty years earlier than the era of Columbus. The Introduction
treats of the ethnology and history of the Huron-Iroquois.
A map, notes and a glossary complete the work.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>No. III. THE COMEDY-BALLET OF GÜEGÜENCE.</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>Edited by DANIEL G. BRINTON, M.D. 146 pages. Cloth, uncut, $2.50.</b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">A curious and unique specimen of the native comic dances,
with dialogues, called <i>bailes</i>, formerly common in Central America. It is in the
mixed Nahuatl-Spanish jargon of Nicaragua, and shows distinctive features of native
authorship. The Introduction treats of the ethnology of Nicaragua, and the local dialects,
musical instruments, and dramatic representations.
A map and a number of illustrations are added.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>No. IV. A MIGRATION LEGEND OF THE CREEK INDIANS.</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>By A. S. GATSCHET. 251 pages. Cloth, uncut, $3.00.</b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">This learned work offers a complete survey of the ethnology
of the native tribes of the Gulf States. The strange myth or legend told to Gov. Oglethorpe,
in 1732, by the Creeks, is given in the original, with an Introduction and Commentary.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>No. V. THE LENÂPÉ AND THEIR LEGENDS.</b></p>
<p class="f90"><b>By Dr. DANIEL G. BRINTON. Cloth, uncut, $3.00.</b></p>

<p class="indent blockquot">Contains the complete text and symbols, 184 in number,
of the <span class="smcap">Walam Olum</span> or <span class="smcap">Red Score</span>
of the Delaware Indians, with the full original text, and a new translation, notes and
vocabulary. A lengthy introduction treats of the Lenâpé or Delawares, their history,
customs, myths, language, etc., with numerous references to other tribes of the great
Algonkin stock.</p>

"The Cherokees had an oration, in which was contained the
history of their migrations, which was lengthy." This tradition related
"that they came from the upper part of the Ohio, where they erected the
mounds on Grave Creek, and that they removed hither [to East Tennessee]
from the country where Monticello is situated." This memory of their
migrations was preserved and handed down by official orators, who
repeated it annually, in public, at the national festival of the green
corn dance. J. Haywood, <i>Natural and Aboriginal History of
Tennessee</i>, pp. 224-237. (Nashville, 1823.) Haywood adds: "It is
now nearly forgotten." I have made vain attempts to recover some
fragments of it from the present residents of the Cherokee Nation.</p></div>

Mr. H. Hale, in <i>The Iroquois Book of Rites</i>, has fully explained
the meaning and importance of the custom of "condolence."
The Stockbridge Indian, Aupaumut, in his Journal, writes of the
Delawares, that when they lose a relative, "according to ancient custom,
long as they are not comforted, they are not to
speak in public, and this ceremonie of comforting each other is highly
esteemed among these nations." <i>Narrative of Hendrick Aupaumut</i>, in

refers to "the ancient covenant of our ancestors," by which this
confederacy was instituted, which included the "Wenaumeew (Unami),
the Wemintheew (Minsi), the Wenuhtokowuk (Nanticokes) and
Kuhnauwantheew (Kanawha)." From old Pennsylvania documents,
Proud gives the members of the confederacy or league as "the
Chiholacki or Delawares, the Wanami, the Munsi, the Mohicans
and Wappingers." <i>History of Penna.</i>, Vol. II, p. 297, note.
Compare J. Long, <i>Voyages and Travels</i>, p. 10 (London, 1791),
who gives the same list. Mr. Ruttenber writes: "In considering the
political relations of the Lenapes, they should be considered as
the most formidable of the Indian confederacies at the time of the
discovery of America, and as having maintained for many years the
position which subsequently fell to the Iroquois."&mdash;<i>Indian Tribes

entitled <i>Notes, Amendments and Additions to Heckewelder's History

born in 1714, died 1778. He acquired the Mohegan dialect among the
converts at Gnadenhütten. His work is without date, but may be placed
at about 1765. It is grammatical rather than lexicographical, and offers

<p>That the Nanticokes came from the South into Maryland has been
maintained, on the ground that as late as 1770 they claimed land in
North Carolina. <i>New York Colonial Documents</i>, Vol. VIII, p. 243.
But the term "Carolina" was, I think, used erroneously in the document
referred to, instead of Maryland, where at that date there were still
many of the tribe.</p></div>

<i>Penna. Archives</i>, Vol. I, p. 230. At the treaty of Easton, 1756,
Tedyuscung, head chief of the Delawares, is stated to have represented the
"Lenopi" Indians (<i>Minutes of the Council</i>, Phila., 1757), and in the
"Conference of Eleven Nations living West of Allegheny," held at
Philadelphia, 1759, the Delawares are included under the tribal name
"Leonopy." See <i>Minutes of the Provincial Council of Penna.</i>, Vol.

Weisberger's translation of Lenni Lenape as "people of the same nation,"
would be more literal if it were put "men of our nation."
<br /><br />
President Stiles, in his <i>Itinerary</i>, makes the statement:
"The Delaware tribe is called <i>Poh-he-gan</i> or <i>Mo-hee-gan</i>
by themselves, and <i>Auquitsaukon.</i>" I have not been able to reach
a satisfactory solution of the first and third of these names.
<br /><br />
That the Delawares did use the term Lenape as their own designation,
is shown by the refrain of one of their chants, preserved by Heckewelder.

See the original Warrant of Survey and Minutes relating
thereto, in Dr. George Smith's <i>History of Delaware County, Pa.</i>,
pp. 209, 210 (Phila., 1862). The derivation is uncertain. Captain John
Smith gives <i>mahcawq</i> for pumpkin, and this appears to be the word
in the native name of Chester Creek, <i>Macopanackhan</i>, which is
also seen in <i>Marcus</i> Hook. (See Smith's <i>Hist. Del. Co.</i>,
pp. 145, 381.) I am inclined to identify the <i>Macocks</i> with the
<i>M'okahoka</i> as "the people of the pumpkin place," or where those
vegetables were cultivated.</p></div>

Heckewelder, in his unpublished MSS, asserts that both
these names mean "Opossum". It is true that the name of this animal
in Lenape is <i>woapink</i>, in the New Jersey dialect <i>opiing</i>,
and in the Nanticoke of Smith <i>oposon</i>, but all these are derived
from the root <i>wab</i>, which originally meant "white," and was
applied to the East as the place of the dawn and the light. The
reference is to the light gray, or whitish, color of the animal's
hair. Compare the Cree, <i>wapiskowes</i>, cendré, il a le poil

The Delawares had three words for dog. One was
<i>allum</i>, which recurs in many Algonkin dialects, and is
derived by Mr. Trumbull from a root signifying "to lay hold of,"
or "to hold fast." The second was <i>lennochum</i> or <i>lenchum</i>,
which means "the quadruped belonging to man;" <i>lenno</i>, man;
<i>chum</i>, a four-footed beast. The third was <i>moekaneu</i>,
a name derived from a general Algonkin root, in Cree, <i>mokku</i>,
meaning "to tear in pieces," from which the Delaware word for bear,
<i>machque</i>, has its origin, and also, significantly enough,
the verb "to eat" in some dialects.</p></div>

the State of Delaware</i>, p. 36 (Phila., 1870), says of the colored
earth of that locality, that it is "a highly argillaceous loam,
interspersed with large and frequent masses of yellow, ochrey clay,
some of which are remarkable for fineness of texture, not unlike
lithomarge, and consists of white, yellow, red and dark blue
clay in detached spots."

The records of my own family furnish an example of this. My
ancestor, William Brinton, arrived in the fall of 1684, and, with his
wife and children, immediately took possession of a grant in the unbroken
wilderness, about twenty miles from Philadelphia. A severe winter set in;
their food supply was exhausted, and they would probably have perished
but for the assistance of some neighboring lodges of Lenape, who provided
them with food and shelter. It is, therefore, a debt of gratitude which I
owe to this nation to gather its legends, its language, and its memories,
so that they,</p>

From the same root, <i>tschip</i>, are derived the Lenape
<i>tschipilek</i>, something strange or wonderful; <i>tschepsit</i>,
a stranger or foreigner; and <i>tschapiet</i>, the invocation of
spirits. Among the rules agreed upon by Zeisberger's converted Indians
was this: "We will use no <i>tschapiet</i>, or witchcraft, when hunting."
(De Schweinitz, <i>Life of Zeisberger</i>, p. 379.)
<br /><br />
The root <i>tschitsch</i> indicates repetition, and applied to the
shadow or spint of man means as much as his double or counterpart.
<br /><br />
A third word for soul was the verbal form <i>w'tellenapewoagan</i>,
"man&mdash;his substance;" but this looks as if it had been manufactured
by the missionaries.</p></div>

are secondary senses. They were wise, and gave true counsel, who could

I am aware that in this proposition I am following the
German and French linguists, Steinthal, F. Müller, Adam, Henry,
etc., and not our own distinguished authority on Algonkin grammar,
Dr J Hammond Trumbull, who, in his essay "On the Algonkin Verb,"
has learnedly maintained another opinion (<i>Transactions of the
American Philological Association</i>, 1876, p. 146). I have not been
able, however, to convince myself that his position is correct.
The formative elements of the Algonkin paradigms appear to me simply
attached particles, and not true inflections Their real character is
obscured by phonetic laws, just as in the Finnish when compared with
the Hungarian.</p></div>

The native name of William Penn offers an instance of this
phonetic alteration. It is given as <i>Onas</i>. The proper form is
<i>Wonach</i>. It literally means the tip or extremity of anything;
as <i>wonach-sitall</i>, the tips of the toes;
<i>wonach-gulinschall</i>, the tips of the fingers. The inanimate
plural form <i>wolanniall</i>, means the tail feathers of a bird.
To explain the name <i>Penn</i> to the Indians a feather was shown
them, probably a quill pen, and hence they gave the translation
<i>Wonach</i>, corrupted into <i>Onas</i>.</p></div>

Some confusion has arisen in this matter, from confounding
the Susquehannocks with the Iroquois, both of
whom were called "Mengwe" by the Delawares, corrupted into "Mingoes."
Thus, a writer in the first half of the 17th century says of the
"Mingoes" that the river tribes "are afraid of them, so that they dare
not stir, much less go to war against them." Thomas Campanius,

The Mohegans seem also to have at one time had a sevenfold division.
At least a writer speaks of the "seven tribes" into which those in
Connecticut were divided. <i>Mass. Hist. Soc. Colls.</i>, Vol. IX (I ser.), p. 90.</p></div>

about 1819. See J. Morse, <i>Report on Indian Affairs</i>, p. 138.</p></div>

This myth was obtained in 1812, from the Shawnees
in Missouri (Schoolcraft, <i>Indian Tribes</i>, Vol. IV, p. 254),
and independently in 1819, from those in Ohio (Mr. John Johnston,
in <i>Trans. of the Amer. Antiq. Soc.</i>, Vol. I, p. 273).
Those of the tribe who now live on the Quapaw Reservation,
Indian Territory, repeat every year a long, probably mythical
and historical, chant, the words of which I have tried, in vain,
to obtain. They say that to repeat it to a white man would bring
disasters on their nation. I mention it as a piece of aboriginal
composition most desirable to secure.</p></div>

 <i>The Good Book; or the Amenities of Nature.
Printed for the Eleutherium of Knowledge</i>.
Philadelphia, 1840, pp. 77, 78. This "Eleutherium," so far
as I can learn, consisted of nobody but Monsieur Rafinesque
himself. Among his manifold projects was a "Divitial System",
by which all interested could soon become large capitalists.
He published a book on it (of course), which might be worth
the attention of a financial economist. The solid men of
Philadelphia, however, like its scholars, turned a deaf ear
to the words of the eccentric foreigner.</p></div>
